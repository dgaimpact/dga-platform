# Potential Additional Config Files (Future Consideration)

These config files are **not required today**, but could be added if the platform expands:

- `platform-specs.json` — technical specifications per platform (GBP, LinkedIn, Facebook)
- `province-codes.json` — official province codes and expansion sequencing
- `content-tier-specs.json` — detailed High/Medium/Low tier definitions
- `schema-templates.json` — reusable schema markup blocks

Current config files already cover core system requirements.

Future additions should only be made if automation or content engines require new reference data.
