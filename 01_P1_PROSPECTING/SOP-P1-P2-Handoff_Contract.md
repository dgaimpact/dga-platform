## 1. Purpose

This SOP defines the **mandatory handoff conditions** between **P1 (Prospecting)** and **P2 (Intake & Onboarding)**.

Its purpose is to:
- prevent premature intake
- protect audit integrity
- avoid downstream remediation
- ensure only qualified, coherent entities enter the system

P1 determines **who may enter**.  
P2 determines **what becomes active**.

This boundary is non-negotiable.

---

## 2. What This SOP Governs

This SOP governs:

- When P1 is considered *complete*
- The minimum criteria required before Intake may begin
- What information may and may not be carried forward
- Enforcement rules when criteria are not met

If P2 begins without satisfying this contract, the intake is invalid.

---

## 3. What This SOP Does *Not* Govern

This SOP does **not** govern:

- How prospecting is performed
- Sales conversations or education
- Pricing discussions
- Audit logic or scoring
- Exceptions once P2 has formally begun

This SOP governs **handoff**, not execution style.

---

## 4. P1 Completion Criteria (All Required)

P1 is considered complete **only when all of the following are true**:

### 4.1 Entity Clarity
- Legal / professional name is known
- Primary role is identified (MP, REA, etc.)
- Market / territory is identified
- Declared niche or positioning exists (even if provisional)

### 4.2 Prospect Qualification
- Prospect understands DGA is governed infrastructure, not marketing
- No outcome guarantees have been implied or inferred
- Capacity constraints have been disclosed and accepted
- Pricing model has been acknowledged

### 4.3 Diagnostic Boundaries
- Any visibility checks performed were **non-authoritative**
- No scoring, ranking, or audit-like outputs were shared
- No remediation or content direction was promised

### 4.4 Disqualification Check
- Prospect does not meet any P1 disqualification criteria
- No unresolved red flags remain

---

## 5. Required Handoff Artifacts

Before P2 may begin, the following must exist:

- Confirmed entity identifiers (name, role, market)
- Declared intent to proceed with onboarding
- A clean handoff note stating:
  - P1 completion date
  - Any known constraints
  - Any provisional assumptions (clearly labeled)

No interpretation or diagnosis may be passed forward.

---

## 6. Prohibited Carryover

The following **must not** cross from P1 into P2:

- Assumptions about visibility or authority
- Informal scoring or comparative language
- Promised outcomes or timelines
- Remediation suggestions
- Content recommendations

P2 begins with **neutral intake**, not inherited conclusions.

---

## 7. Enforcement Rule

If P2 begins without meeting all P1 completion criteria:

- Intake must be paused
- Missing criteria must be resolved
- No audit or content work may proceed

Execution convenience does not override governance.

---

## 8. Lock Statement

This SOP is authoritative.

Any intake, audit, or downstream execution initiated without satisfying this P1 → P2 handoff contract is invalid and must be corrected.
