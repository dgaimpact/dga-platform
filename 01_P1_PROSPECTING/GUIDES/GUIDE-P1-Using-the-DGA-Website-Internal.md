## 1. Purpose of This Guide

This guide exists to ensure the DGA website is used **correctly and consistently** by humans.

It explains:
- what the website is for
- what it is not for
- how to sanity-check ideas before they become problems

This guide is **non-governing** and **non-executing**.  
Governance lives in the Blueprint, Registry, and Execution Doctrine.

---

## 2. When to Use This Guide

Use this guide when:

- evaluating a new page idea
- deciding whether something belongs on the website
- explaining the website’s role to partners or collaborators
- feeling tempted to “just add one thing”

Do **not** use this guide to:
- justify exceptions
- override governance
- reinterpret intent

If there is a conflict, governance wins.

## 3. What the DGA Website Is (and Is Not)

### What This Website *Is*

- A belief-signaling surface
- A worldview declaration
- A prospect filter
- A source of intentional friction
- A place where misalignment is allowed to surface

### What This Website *Is Not*

- A marketing site
- A sales funnel
- A lead-generation tool
- A credibility-proving surface
- A place to reassure uncertainty
- A bridge into execution

If it feels like marketing, it does not belong here.

## 4. How to Evaluate a Page or Content Idea

Before adding anything, ask **all** of the following:

1. Does this express belief, or does it persuade?
2. Does this increase clarity of worldview, or reduce friction?
3. Would a misaligned prospect feel encouraged by this?
4. Does this imply outcomes, progress, or improvement?
5. Does this quietly act like a CTA?

If the answer to **any** of these is “yes,” it does not belong.

## 5. What Success Looks Like

Success is **quiet**.

Indicators of success include:
- fewer but better-aligned inquiries
- prospects who already understand boundaries
- early opt-outs without follow-up
- no pressure to “optimize” the site

There is no failure mode where more traffic equals success.

---

## 6. Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Adding “just one” CTA
- Including pricing “for transparency”
- Publishing testimonials to “build trust”
- Explaining *why* the beliefs are correct
- Softening language to avoid discomfort
- Borrowing language from marketing instincts

Discomfort is not a bug.

## 7. How to Hand Off to P2 Intake

The website’s job ends when belief alignment is clear.

If someone is ready for P2:
- the transition should feel deliberate, not guided
- no urgency should be implied
- no automation should bridge the gap

If someone hesitates, the website has done its job.

---

## 8. Final Reminder

The DGA website protects the system by **saying less, not more**.

When in doubt:
- remove instead of add
- clarify instead of expand
- protect belief over growth
