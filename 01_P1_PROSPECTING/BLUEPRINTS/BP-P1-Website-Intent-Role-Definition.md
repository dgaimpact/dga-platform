## FOUNDER DOCTRINE

The DGA website is not a marketing asset.

It exists to express conviction, not pursue conversion.

If the website attempts to persuade, reassure, prove, optimize, or soften uncertainty, it has violated its purpose. Its role is to surface DGA’s beliefs so clearly that alignment is self-evident and misalignment is frictionless.

The website must protect downstream pillars by ensuring only belief-aligned professionals ever reach intake.

---

## 1. Purpose & Authority

This Blueprint defines the intent, role, and non-negotiable boundaries of the DGA website as a P1 — Prospecting surface.

This document is authoritative and binding.

Any page, feature, copy, or system behavior that conflicts with this Blueprint must be corrected or removed.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

Most professionals entering AI-visibility or marketing systems do so with misaligned assumptions, including expectations of:

- tactics and hacks
- guarantees or outcomes
- speed, shortcuts, or optimization

These assumptions corrupt audit integrity, execution discipline, and relationship trust.

The DGA website exists to filter belief misalignment before intake, protecting the integrity of all downstream pillars.

---

## 3. Scope — What This Blueprint Governs

This Blueprint governs:

- The role of the DGA website within P1
- The intent behind all website content
- The boundaries of what the website may and may not do
- The handoff conditions between the website and P2 Intake
- The criteria used to accept or reject future website decisions

---

## 4. Explicit Exclusions — What This Blueprint Does NOT Govern

This Blueprint does not govern:

- Page layout or visual design
- Copywriting execution
- SEO, GEO, or AIO tactics
- Conversion strategy or optimization
- Pricing or plan presentation
- Subscriber dashboards or tooling
- Any execution owned by P2–P5

Execution detail belongs downstream.

---

## 5. Core Definitions

Belief-Aligned Prospecting Surface  
A read-only system that communicates worldview and operating assumptions without persuasion, validation, or inducement.

Self-Selection  
A prospect’s decision to proceed or disengage based solely on belief alignment.

Early Friction  
Intentional resistance that discourages misaligned prospects before intake.

---

## 6. Foundational Principles

- Conviction outranks clarity
- Alignment outranks volume
- Belief precedes eligibility
- Friction is a feature, not a flaw
- Silence is an acceptable outcome

---

## 7. Invariants & Non-Negotiables

The DGA website must:

- Remain strictly read-only
- Never promise or imply outcomes
- Never argue or defend its beliefs
- Never collapse or soften uncertainty
- Never optimize for conversion
- Never initiate P2 Intake automatically
- Never perform, preview, or imply audits
- Never function as sales collateral

Violation of any invariant invalidates the implementation.

---

## 8. Pillar Ownership & Responsibilities

Primary Pillar: P1 — Prospecting

P1 owns:
- belief signaling
- expectation setting
- eligibility framing
- downstream protection

The website defines who should proceed, not how they are onboarded.

---

## 9. Relationships to Other Pillars

P2 — Intake & Onboarding  
Access permitted only after belief alignment

P3 — Audit  
Explicitly excluded

P4 — Content Creation & Publishing  
Explicitly excluded

P5 — Relationship Continuity  
Explicitly excluded

The website’s responsibility ends before activation.

---

## 10. Downstream Enforcement & Consumption Rules

- Execution Doctrines must enforce read-only behavior
- Registries must classify the website as a Prospecting Surface
- Systems must prevent cross-pillar feature creep
- Human operators must treat this Blueprint as a rejection filter

---

## 11. Change, Replacement & Persistence Rules

- All changes require a version increment
- Any change that weakens belief signaling is invalid
- This Blueprint persists unless formally deprecated through governance review

---

## 12. Compliance & Auditability

Compliance is verified by:
- Blueprint-to-Execution Doctrine alignment
- Registry classification consistency
- Absence of prohibited behaviors or surfaces

Any violation requires remediation before release.

---

## 13. Lock Statement

This Blueprint is authoritative and binding.  
Any system, document, page, or behavior that conflicts with it must be corrected to align with it.
