## FOUNDER DOCTRINE

Structure precedes language.

If the website structure allows persuasion, education depth, optimization, or execution to creep in, belief alignment collapses regardless of copy discipline. This Blueprint exists to ensure the **shape of the website itself enforces belief alignment** before any words are written.

If a page does not have a clear belief-aligned job, it must not exist.

---

## 1. Purpose & Authority

This Blueprint defines the **allowed structure, page types, hierarchy, and navigation rules** of the DGA website as a **P1 Prospecting surface**.

It is authoritative and binding.

Any page, route, navigation element, or structural pattern that conflicts with this Blueprint must be removed or corrected.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

Without a locked structure, belief-aligned intent erodes through:
- incremental page additions
- convenience-driven navigation
- educational sprawl
- copy-based justification for new surfaces
- implicit funnel design

These failures convert a prospecting surface into a marketing or education site by accident.

This Blueprint prevents that outcome by constraining **what the website can physically be**.

---

## 3. Scope — What This Blueprint Governs

This Blueprint governs:

- Canonical website page types
- Page inclusion and exclusion rules
- Page hierarchy and sequencing
- Navigation constraints
- Entry and exit conditions
- Structural separation between P1 and all other pillars

---

## 4. Explicit Exclusions — What This Blueprint Does NOT Govern

This Blueprint does **not** govern:

- Page copy or messaging
- Visual design or UI
- SEO, GEO, or AIO considerations
- Analytics implementation
- Blog or authority content publishing
- External messaging or referral strategy
- Any execution owned by P2–P5

---

## 5. Canonical Website Page Set (Hard-Limited)

The DGA P1 website may contain **only** the following page types.

### 5.1 Primary Pages (Required)

| Page Type | Intent |
|---------|--------|
| Entry / Overview Page | Establish worldview and belief context |
| Belief Statement Page | Explicit articulation of DGA beliefs |
| System Boundaries Page | What DGA does and does not do |
| How DGA Operates (High-Level) | Non-tactical system framing |
| Who This Is For / Not For | Explicit self-selection guidance |

All primary pages are **declarative, finite, and non-persuasive**.

---

### 5.2 Secondary Pages (Optional)

Secondary pages may exist **only if they reduce ambiguity without reducing friction**.

| Page Type | Intent |
|---------|--------|
| Glossary / Definitions | Reduce misinterpretation |
| Governance Overview | Explain discipline, not benefits |
| FAQ (Belief-Based Only) | Address assumptions, not objections |

Secondary pages must never introduce education depth or encouragement.

---

## 6. Explicitly Prohibited Page Types

The following page types are **forbidden on the P1 website**:

- Blog or article feeds
- Educational content libraries
- Thought leadership hubs
- Pricing or plans
- Sales pages
- Conversion funnels
- Intake or application pages
- Audit previews or diagnostics
- Testimonials or case studies
- Comparison pages
- Resource downloads or lead magnets

Presence of any prohibited page invalidates compliance.

---

## 7. Authority Content & Blog Separation (Critical)

All long-form educational or authority content—including content about:
- AI systems
- GEO / AIO behavior
- audit methodologies
- ecosystem analysis

**MUST NOT reside on the P1 website.**

Such content belongs exclusively to the **Authority Hub**, governed by:
- P3 — Audit (inputs)
- P4 — Content Creation & Publishing (execution)

### Relationship Rule

- The P1 website may include **a single neutral reference** acknowledging the existence of the Authority Hub
- No excerpts, previews, featured posts, or browsing pathways are permitted
- Belief alignment must never depend on authority content consumption

The Authority Hub is **adjacent**, not integral, to P1.

---

## 8. Page Sequencing & Hierarchy Rules

- There is no funnel
- Pages may be consumed in any order
- No page may imply progression
- No “next step” language is permitted
- No page may function as a gateway

The website is intentionally **non-linear**.

---

## 9. Navigation Rules

Allowed:
- Flat or shallow navigation
- Neutral, descriptive labels
- Internal links between belief-aligned pages

Forbidden:
- Action-oriented labels
- Highlighted “primary” actions
- Visual emphasis on progression
- Persistent prompts to continue

Navigation must not suggest movement or urgency.

---

## 10. Entry & Exit Conditions

### Entry
- All entry points land on belief-context pages
- No deep links may bypass belief framing

### Exit
- The website does not send users anywhere
- No automated or embedded handoff is allowed
- Transition to P2 Intake must be deliberate and external

---

## 11. Structural Separation from Other Surfaces

The following surfaces must be structurally and navigationally separate:

| Surface | Pillar | Relationship to P1 |
|------|--------|--------------------|
| Authority Hub | P4 | Adjacent, not central |
| Profession Entry Pages | P2 | Separate surface |
| Account Hub | P2–P5 | Private, authenticated |
| Trust Index / Network | PW | Public, non-prospecting |

No shared navigation is permitted.

---

## 12. Downstream Enforcement & Consumption Rules

- CMS and generators must enforce the canonical page list
- Unauthorized pages must be blocked at build time
- Navigation changes require Blueprint validation
- Humans may not override structure for convenience

---

## 13. Change, Replacement & Persistence Rules

- Any change requires a version increment
- Adding a new page type requires Blueprint amendment
- Structure may not evolve reactively
- Drift constitutes a governance failure

---

## 14. Lock Statement

This Blueprint is authoritative and binding.  
If a page, route, or navigation element conflicts with this structure, it must not ship.
