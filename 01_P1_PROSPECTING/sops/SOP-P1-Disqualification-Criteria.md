## 1. Purpose

This SOP defines **explicit disqualification criteria** for prospects evaluated during **P1 — Prospecting**.

Its purpose is to:
- protect downstream pillars from poor-fit activation
- preserve audit and content integrity
- prevent expectation misalignment
- ensure DGA remains governed infrastructure, not a marketing service

Disqualification is not failure.  
It is **system protection**.

---

## 2. What This SOP Governs

This SOP governs:

- When a prospect must **not** proceed to Intake
- Conditions that invalidate readiness for DGA participation
- Non-negotiable exclusions based on behavior, intent, or constraints

If any disqualification criterion is met, **P2 must not begin**.

---

## 3. What This SOP Does *Not* Govern

This SOP does **not** govern:

- Temporary deferrals where criteria may be resolved
- Pricing objections or timing constraints
- Educational conversations prior to qualification
- Exceptions once Intake (P2) has formally begun

This SOP governs **entry denial**, not pacing.

---

## 4. Non-Negotiable Disqualification Criteria

A prospect is **immediately disqualified** if **any** of the following are true.

### 4.1 Outcome-Driven Intent

- Prospect seeks guaranteed rankings, leads, traffic, or AI placement
- Prospect insists on performance promises or timelines
- Prospect frames success exclusively in volume or conversion outcomes

DGA governs execution discipline — not outcomes.

---

### 4.2 Marketing Service Expectation

- Prospect views DGA as a replacement for marketing, ads, or SEO services
- Prospect expects tactical optimization or growth hacks
- Prospect resists governance, structure, or constraints

DGA is infrastructure, not promotion.

---

### 4.3 Audit Boundary Violation

- Prospect requests scoring, diagnosis, or recommendations during P1
- Prospect pressures for remediation before audit
- Prospect compares themselves competitively without audit context

Audit authority exists only in P3.

---

### 4.4 Capacity or Scarcity Resistance

- Prospect disputes market capacity limits
- Prospect expects exceptions due to payment source or size
- Prospect attempts to bypass scarcity rules

Scarcity is structural, not negotiable.

---

### 4.5 Entity Ambiguity or Misrepresentation

- Prospect cannot clearly define role, market, or professional identity
- Prospect misrepresents credentials, licensing, or authority
- Prospect resists normalization of entity data

DGA requires entity clarity before activation.

---

### 4.6 Governance Rejection

- Prospect resists documentation, versioning, or review discipline
- Prospect pushes for undocumented changes or informal exceptions
- Prospect demonstrates disregard for system boundaries

Governance is not optional.

---

## 5. Conditional Deferral (Not Disqualification)

The following conditions may warrant **deferral**, not disqualification:

- Timing constraints (budget cycles, seasonality)
- Temporary data gaps that can be resolved
- Education gaps where expectations can be corrected

Deferral must be explicit and documented.

---

## 6. Enforcement Rule

If any disqualification criterion is met:

- P1 must terminate the prospecting path
- P2 intake must not begin
- No audit, content, or system work may proceed

Execution convenience does not override system integrity.

---

## 7. Lock Statement

This SOP is authoritative.

Any prospect that meets a P1 disqualification criterion must not proceed into Intake or any downstream DGA system.
