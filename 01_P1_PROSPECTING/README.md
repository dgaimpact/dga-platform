## 1. Purpose of P1 — Prospecting

P1 — Prospecting governs **who enters the DGA ecosystem and under what conditions**.

This pillar exists to:
- attract the *right* prospects, not maximize volume
- educate before selling
- qualify suitability without promises or outcomes
- protect downstream pillars from poor-fit subscribers

Prospecting is **not sales execution**.  
It is **eligibility determination and expectation-setting**.

---

## 2. What This Pillar Owns

P1 owns all systems, documents, and logic related to:

- Education-first positioning of DGA
- Prospect diagnostics and pre-intake analysis
- Visibility and recommendability *pre-checks*
- Qualification criteria and disqualification logic
- Entry pathways into P2 (Intake & Onboarding)

P1 defines **who should proceed** — not *how* they are onboarded.

---

## 3. What This Pillar Explicitly Does NOT Own

P1 does **not** own:

- Subscriber onboarding or activation (P2)
- Audits for active subscribers (P3)
- Content creation or publishing (P4)
- Ongoing relationship management (P5)
- CRM workflows for active accounts

If a prospect becomes an **ACTIVE subscriber**, ownership transfers to P2.

## 5. Governing Constraints

- P1 must never promise outcomes
- P1 must never bypass qualification
- P1 outputs may inform P2, but may not activate accounts
- Diagnostics performed in P1 are **non-authoritative**
- Any audit-like activity in P1 must defer to P3 definitions

---

## 6. Key Principle

> **P1 filters for fit.  
> It does not optimize for conversion.**

Protecting the integrity of downstream pillars is the primary responsibility of Prospecting.
