# Digital Growth Accelerator (DGA) — Platform Knowledge Base

*A governed, pillar-based operating system for AI visibility, content authority, and relationship continuity.*

---

## What This Repository Is

This repository is the **single source of truth** for the Digital Growth Accelerator (DGA) platform.

It contains all governing documents, pillar execution artifacts, systems, automations, and operational references required to **design, operate, scale, and audit** DGA.

This repository is **governed**, **version-controlled**, and **pillar-aligned**.

---

## Governing Authority (Read First)

All documents and systems in this repository are governed by:

- **`00_FOUNDATIONS/GOVERNANCE/DGA_BUSINESS_MODEL.md`**
- **`00_FOUNDATIONS/GOVERNANCE/PILLAR_LOCK_REFERENCE.md`**

If any document conflicts with these authorities, the conflict is resolved **there first**.

This README is **navigational only**.

---

## DGA Operational Pillars (Primary Navigation)

DGA operates on **five locked operational pillars**.  
Pillars define **ownership, sequencing, and execution boundaries**.

Each pillar contains its own:
- Blueprints
- Execution Doctrines (EDs)
- Systems
- Automations
- SOPs (where applicable)

---

### **P1 — Prospecting**
**Purpose:** Who should enter the DGA ecosystem.

Includes:
- Education-first positioning
- Prospect diagnostics
- Pre-intake visibility checks

---

### **P2 — Intake & Onboarding**
**Purpose:** Who the subscriber actually is at activation.

Includes:
- Entity normalization
- NAP and platform validation
- Readiness for audit and publishing systems

---

### **P3 — Audit**
**Purpose:** Understand visibility and recommendability without bias.

Includes:
- Snapshot audits
- Internal ecosystem monitoring
- Adhoc diagnostic audits

---

### **P4 — Content Creation & Publishing**
**Purpose:** Create and distribute structured authority content.

Includes:
- Long-form content creation
- Canonical publishing (DGA Authority Hub)
- Managed omni-channel population

---

### **P5 — Relationship Continuity**
**Purpose:** Ensure no active subscriber relationship goes cold or transactional.

Includes:
- Human-led outreach cadence
- Continuity tracking
- Escalation without automation of intent

---

## Shared Platform & Cross-Pillar Assets

Some assets support **multiple pillars** and are intentionally centralized.

### **00_FOUNDATIONS/**
Governance, templates, registries, and canonical references.

Includes:
- Business Model
- Pillar Lock Reference
- Templates (ED, BP)
- Canonical registries

---

### **90_SHARED_PLATFORM/** *(or equivalent)*
Cross-cutting assets that do not belong to a single pillar.

Includes:
- Stack & integration documentation
- StackAI Prompt Library
- Sales and positioning assets
- Style and standards references

---

### **99_ARCHIVE/**
Deprecated, superseded, or legacy materials.

All archived items must be clearly marked and must not govern active systems.

---

## How to Navigate This Repository

### New to DGA?
Start with:
1. `00_FOUNDATIONS/GOVERNANCE/DGA_BUSINESS_MODEL.md`
2. `00_FOUNDATIONS/GOVERNANCE/PILLAR_LOCK_REFERENCE.md`
3. Then explore each pillar folder in order (P1 → P5)

---

### Working on Systems or Automations?
Navigate to the **pillar that owns the behavior**, then:
- `SYSTEMS/`
- `AUTOMATIONS/`
- `EXECUTION_DOCTRINES/`

---

### Writing or Updating Docs?
- Governance → `00_FOUNDATIONS`
- Pillar behavior → that pillar’s folder
- Cross-pillar assets → `90_SHARED_PLATFORM`
- Uncertain legacy items → `99_ARCHIVE`

---

## Versioning & Change Discipline

This repository follows:
- Versioned governing documents
- Pillar ownership enforcement
- No silent changes
- Deterministic execution rules for systems

Governance always precedes implementation.
