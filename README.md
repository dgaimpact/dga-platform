# Digital Growth Accelerator (DGA) — Platform Knowledge Base  
*A unified, version-controlled architecture for all DGA frameworks, systems, standards, and operational workflows.*

---

## Purpose of This Repository
This repository serves as the **single source of truth** for the entire Digital Growth Accelerator (DGA) ecosystem.  
It centralizes all knowledge, standards, and operational assets required to deliver, scale, and maintain DGA across:

- Frameworks (Brand Voice, OCGF, GEO/AI Visibility, MP–REA Engagement)
- Standards (output, tone, GEO/AI, instruction, prompt construction, audit evidence)
- Systems (Notion CRM, Playbook Engine, Content Engine, Audit Engine)
- Workflows (voice acquisition, audits, content production, CRM routing)
- Platform integrations (Notion, Google Workspace, GitHub, n8n, Telegram)
- SOPs and operational playbooks
- Audit tools, routing protocols, templates
- Automation specifications and code

This Knowledge Base ensures that **every part of DGA is documented, auditable, upgradeable, and future-proof.**
