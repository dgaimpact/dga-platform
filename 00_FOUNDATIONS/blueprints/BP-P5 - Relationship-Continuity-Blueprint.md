## BP–P5–RELATIONSHIP CONTINUITY BLUEPRINT
Relationship Continuity Intent, Boundaries & Governance

Version: v1.0  
Created: 2025-12-13  
Status: Governing Authority (Active)

Related DGA Pillars (Reference Only):
• P3 – Audit  
• P4 – Content Creation & Publishing  
• P5 – Post-Publish Reinforcement

FOUNDER DOCTRINE

This Blueprint documents decisions already made.

It exists to:

• prevent relational pressure from re-entering the system  
• constrain interpretation of “follow-up” and “continuity”  
• protect long-term trust  
• ensure execution respects availability over persistence  

If a downstream system, Execution Doctrine, SOP, or automation
conflicts with this Blueprint, the conflict must be resolved here first.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

## 1. Authority & Scope

**Document Type:** Blueprint (BP)  
**Pillar:** P5 — Relationship Continuity  
**Authority Level:** Governing (Intent & Boundaries)  
**Status:** Canonical — Draft for Lock  

This document defines **what Relationship Continuity is and is not** within DGA.

It governs:
- intent
- boundaries
- allowed language
- conceptual states
- interaction with other pillars

It does **not** define:
- workflows
- queues
- CRM logic
- tooling
- field names
- automation behavior

Those belong downstream in Execution Doctrines and Registries.

## 2. Purpose of Relationship Continuity

Relationship Continuity exists to ensure that **valuable relationships are respected over time without pressure, pursuit, or decay**.

It answers one question only:

> *How does DGA remain present, reliable, and available without chasing or escalating?*

Continuity is about **maintaining a stable line of connection**, not driving action.

---

## 3. What Relationship Continuity Is Not

Relationship Continuity is explicitly **not**:

- lead nurturing
- follow-up optimization
- conversion sequencing
- persuasion
- reminder escalation
- sales enablement
- outcome acceleration

Any logic designed to **increase response probability** violates this pillar.

---

## 4. Foundational Principle

**Availability without insistence.**

DGA assumes:
- people are busy
- timing matters
- silence is neutral
- non-response is not rejection

The system adapts to availability — it does not attempt to override it.

---

## 5. Canonical Continuity Model (Conceptual)

Relationship Continuity operates through **state awareness**, not pressure.

At a conceptual level, relationships move through observable states such as:

- **Available** — engagement occurs naturally  
- **Not Available** — contact attempted, no interaction  
- **Paused** — intentionally held without action  
- **Re-Queued** — scheduled re-availability window  
- **Dormant** — no active engagement expectation  

These are **descriptive states**, not triggers.

No state implies urgency, deficiency, or escalation.

---

## 6. Time as a Respect Signal

Time is used to **create space**, not momentum.

Key principles:
- pauses are intentional
- re-entry is scheduled, not reactive
- time gaps reduce pressure, not increase it
- absence of activity is acceptable

Shortening timeframes to provoke response is prohibited.

---

## 7. Relationship to Other Pillars

### P3 — Audit
- Audits may **inform timing**
- Audits never dictate pursuit
- Audit insights do not justify urgency

### P4 — Content
- Content may exist independently of contact
- Content distribution does not reset continuity states

### P1 / P2 — Prospecting & Intake
- Continuity applies only **after** a relationship exists
- Prospecting logic does not bleed into P5

---

## 8. Language & Framing Constraints

Allowed language:
- calm
- optional
- informational
- availability-based
- non-assumptive

Forbidden language:
- “just checking in”
- “following up”
- “did you see…”
- urgency framing
- guilt framing
- scarcity or deadline language

Silence must never be framed as a problem.

---

## 9. Human & System Roles

### System Role
- record attempts
- respect pauses
- honor re-entry timing
- prevent over-contact

### Human Role
- accept non-response
- avoid improvisation
- trust the system cadence
- refrain from manual chasing

Humans do not override continuity because of impatience.

---

## 10. Governance Rules (Non-Negotiable)

1. Continuity ≠ conversion  
2. Silence ≠ failure  
3. Time creates trust  
4. No escalation paths  
5. No chase logic  
6. Respect beats persistence  

If a proposed behavior conflicts with these rules, it is rejected unless this Blueprint is formally revised.

---

## 11. Downstream Dependencies (Declaration Only)

This Blueprint will be enforced through:
- **ED-P5 — Relationship Continuity Execution Doctrine**
- Schema & State Registries
- SOPs for human interaction

Those documents must **implement**, not reinterpret, this intent.

---

## 12. Lock Statement

This Blueprint exists to prevent relational pressure from creeping back into the system under different names.

Relationship Continuity is not a tactic.  
It is a **design stance**.
