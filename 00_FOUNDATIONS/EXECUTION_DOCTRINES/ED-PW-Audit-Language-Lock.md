## 1. Authority & Purpose

This Execution Doctrine locks **subscriber-facing audit language** to prevent:
- scope misunderstanding
- perceived audit variance
- implied hierarchy of audit “strength”
- misinterpretation of ad-hoc diagnostics

It exists to ensure:
- clarity
- consistency
- defensibility
- zero exposure of internal system mechanics

This doctrine is **binding**.

If language deviates from this doctrine, the communication is invalid.

---

## 2. Core Language Principle (Non-Negotiable)

> **There is only one audit that counts: the scheduled audit.**

All scheduled audits are:
- full
- authoritative
- comparable over time

Ad-hoc audits are **never** described as audits in subscriber-facing contexts.

---

## 3. Approved Subscriber-Facing Terminology

The following terms are **explicitly permitted**.

### 3.1 Scheduled Audits

Use:
- **Baseline Audit**  
  *(Day 00 only)*

- **Monthly Audit**  
  *(All recurring scheduled audits)*

- **Latest Audit**  
  *(Most recent scheduled audit)*

Optional qualifiers:
- “Your latest monthly audit…”
- “Based on your most recent audit…”

---

### 3.2 Audit Timing References

Permitted phrasing:
- “This audit reflects a point-in-time view.”
- “Audits are performed monthly.”
- “Each audit captures the ecosystem as it exists at that time.”

---

### 3.3 Diagnostic Activity (Non-Audit)

Use:
- **Diagnostic Check**
- **Internal Review**
- **System Validation**

These terms must:
- never include scores
- never include deltas
- never be stored as reports
- never be referenced historically

---

## 4. Explicitly Prohibited Terminology

The following terms must **never** appear in subscriber-facing content:

- snapshot
- mini audit
- partial audit
- light audit
- interim audit
- ad-hoc audit
- manual audit
- re-run
- refresh
- recalculation
- retry

If a term implies audit hierarchy or mutability, it is prohibited.

---

## 5. Prohibited Implications (Language-Level)

Subscriber-facing language must **never imply**:

- audits can be requested
- audits can be accelerated
- audits can be redone
- audits change because of content
- audits validate performance or effort
- audits predict outcomes

Audits observe.  
They do not judge, reward, or promise.

---

## 6. PB-Specific Language Constraints

### 6.1 PB Parent (MP)

Permitted:
- “Governance check”
- “Account integrity review”
- “Platform compliance status”

Prohibited:
- “Audit results” (deep scoring language)
- “Performance indicators”
- “Ranking language”

---

### 6.2 PB Child (REA)

Permitted:
- “Baseline Audit”
- “Monthly Audit”
- “Audit-informed content”

Prohibited:
- Comparisons to other PB Children
- Any reference to PB Parent audit outcomes

Isolation is mandatory.

---

## 7. Human Communication Enforcement

All humans communicating with subscribers must:

- follow this terminology exactly
- avoid improvisation
- default to approved language
- escalate ambiguity instead of rephrasing

Clarity outranks conversational flair.

---

## 8. Enforcement & Validation

Systems must:

- template all audit-related language
- prevent free-text substitution
- block prohibited terms where feasible
- treat violations as correctness failures

Human violations must be corrected, not contextualized.

---

## 9. Change Control

Changes require:
- Blueprint compatibility review
- downstream doctrine compatibility check
- version increment
- documented rationale

Silent language drift is prohibited.
