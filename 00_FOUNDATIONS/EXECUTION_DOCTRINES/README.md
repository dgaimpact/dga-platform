# Execution Doctrines (ED)

This directory contains **Execution Doctrines (EDs)** that define **how governed rules are executed** within the DGA platform.

Execution Doctrines sit **between** Registries (REG) and application code.

They are authoritative for execution behavior but **derive their authority** from Registries and Blueprints.
