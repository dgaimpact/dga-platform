## 1. Purpose of This Guide

This guide explains **how Realtor (REA) referral partners are onboarded within Playbook (PB)** and what that onboarding does — and does not — mean.

It exists to:
- clarify how REA partners are added
- protect relationship boundaries and trust
- explain what REA partners receive
- prevent PB from being positioned as marketing or lead gen

PB onboarding supports relationships.  
It does not manage them for you.

---

## 2. When to Use This Guide

Use this guide:
- before inviting an REA into PB
- when explaining PB to a referral partner
- when deciding whether a relationship is a good fit
- when reviewing how existing REA partners are supported

Do not use this guide:
- as a recruiting script
- as a pressure tool
- as a promise of referrals or exposure

## 3. What This Guide Is (and Is Not)

### What This Guide *Is*
- a clear explanation of PB partner onboarding
- a reference for expectation-setting
- a safeguard for relationship integrity

### What This Guide *Is Not*
- a marketing funnel
- a referral contract
- a performance or volume commitment
- a substitute for real communication

---

## 4. What PB REA Onboarding Actually Does

When an REA is onboarded into PB:
- they are added as a **clean, independent sub-account**
- their professional identity remains their own
- their content and visibility are structured and supported
- alignment with you is reinforced through consistency

They are **not** added “under” you in a promotional sense.

---

## 5. What PB REA Onboarding Does *Not* Do

PB REA onboarding does not:
- take over the relationship
- automate referrals
- merge brands or voices
- require exclusivity
- obligate either party

Participation supports visibility — not obligation.

---

## 6. What Information Is Collected for REA Partners

REA onboarding focuses on the same fundamentals as any DGA account:
- professional name and role
- primary market or service area
- core professional profiles
- website and Google Business Profile (if applicable)
- Voice Blueprint to preserve how they communicate

This ensures accuracy and independence.

---

## 7. How Content and Visibility Are Handled

For REA partners:
- content is created for their professional presence
- publishing follows the same governed structure
- Voice Blueprint ensures content sounds like them
- alignment with you is structural, not promotional

No partner competes with or overshadows the other.

---

## 8. Visibility and Oversight for PB Subscribers

As the PB subscriber:
- you retain ownership of the relationship
- you have **visibility**, not control, over REA activity
- oversight is provided through the Account Hub
- you are not required to manage execution

Transparency replaces micromanagement.

---

## 9. Relationship Continuity Expectations

PB REA onboarding works best when:
- the relationship already exists
- trust is already present
- expectations are discussed openly

DGA supports continuity through:
- structure
- visibility
- gentle signals when things go quiet

Human judgment always comes first.

---

## 10. When *Not* to Onboard an REA

PB REA onboarding may not be appropriate when:
- the relationship is transactional
- expectations are unclear or one-sided
- either party expects guaranteed outcomes
- trust has not yet been established

PB should reinforce good relationships — not force them.

---

## 11. What to Do Next

If you are considering onboarding an REA:
- review the **PB Positioning Guide**
- reflect on relationship fit
- introduce PB calmly and clearly

If an REA is already onboarded:
- focus on consistency
- let the structure do the work
- keep the relationship human

---

## 12. Final Notes

PB REA onboarding exists to make **strong relationships more durable**, not more complicated.

When used correctly:
- it feels supportive
- it stays respectful
- it compounds trust over time
