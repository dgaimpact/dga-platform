## 1. Purpose of This Guide

This guide explains **why professional consistency matters**, how inconsistency causes problems, and what DGA does to protect you from it.

It exists to:
- explain why small inconsistencies have outsized impact
- clarify what “consistency” actually means in practice
- show how DGA maintains alignment without ongoing effort from you

Consistency is not polish.  
It is **recognition infrastructure**.

## 2. When to Use This Guide

Use this guide:
- during onboarding
- when reviewing or updating professional profiles
- when adding PB referral partners
- anytime something “feels off” about visibility or recognition

Do not use this guide:
- as a branding exercise
- to redesign your marketing
- to experiment with positioning

## 3. What This Guide Is (and Is Not)

### What This Guide *Is*
- an explanation of how recognition works
- a guardrail against silent visibility erosion
- a reference for clean professional signals

### What This Guide *Is Not*
- a style guide
- a logo or branding document
- a creative positioning framework

---

## 4. What We Mean by “Entity Consistency”

Entity consistency means that **the same professional shows up the same way everywhere**.

This includes:
- name and naming format
- professional role
- geographic market
- niche or focus
- tone and positioning (supported by Voice Blueprint)

AI systems and humans rely on repetition to recognize who you are.

---

## 5. Where Inconsistency Usually Appears

Common problem areas include:
- slightly different business names across platforms
- different job titles in different places
- mixed personal and professional profiles
- outdated websites or bios
- inconsistent location or service-area descriptions

Individually, these feel minor.  
Collectively, they cause confusion.

---

## 6. Why Consistency Matters for Visibility

Consistency helps:
- AI systems recognize you as one clear professional entity
- humans quickly understand who you are and what you do
- referrals feel confident sharing your name
- your presence compound instead of fragment

Inconsistency forces systems and people to **guess**.  
Guessing weakens trust.

## 7. How DGA Protects Consistency for You

DGA maintains consistency by:
- capturing clean information during intake
- normalizing identity signals across platforms
- using your Voice Blueprint to preserve tone and language
- governing how content is created and published
- monitoring visibility without constant changes

You do not need to manage this daily.

---

## 8. Consistency and Referral Relationships (PB Only)

For PB subscribers:
- consistency protects both sides of the relationship
- MP and REA identities remain distinct but aligned
- neither partner competes with or overshadows the other

This makes referral relationships:
- clearer
- more credible
- easier to explain to others

---

## 9. What You Should (and Should Not) Change

You should:
- keep your professional identity stable
- update information only when something materially changes
- let DGA handle alignment and structure

You should not:
- frequently change titles or descriptions
- experiment with messaging across platforms
- “optimize” profiles independently

Stability beats novelty.

---

## 10. What to Do If Something Is Wrong

If you notice:
- incorrect information
- outdated details
- inconsistent profiles

Do not patch it everywhere yourself.

Flag it once and let alignment be handled correctly.

---

## 11. Final Notes

Recognition is built through repetition.

The clearer and more consistent your presence:
- the easier you are to recognize
- the easier you are to trust
- the more durable your visibility becomes
