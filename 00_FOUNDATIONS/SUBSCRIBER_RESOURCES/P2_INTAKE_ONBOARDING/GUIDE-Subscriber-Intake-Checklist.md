## 1. Purpose of This Guide

This guide explains **what information is required** before DGA can begin audits, content creation, or publishing.

It exists to:
- prevent delays during onboarding
- ensure accuracy across platforms
- protect downstream systems from bad or missing data
- set clear expectations before activation

DGA works best when intake is done **once and done right**.

---

## 2. When to Use This Guide

Use this guide:
- before starting DGA onboarding
- when preparing information for a new account
- when adding PB referral partners (REA sub-accounts)

Do not use this guide:
- as a substitute for onboarding
- to guess or approximate missing information

If something is unclear, pause and clarify before proceeding.

## 3. What This Guide Is (and Is Not)

### What This Guide *Is*
- a preparation checklist
- a data accuracy reference
- a way to avoid onboarding friction

### What This Guide *Is Not*
- a technical realization document
- a marketing checklist
- a task list for ongoing work

---

## 4. Core Information Required (All Subscribers)

You will be asked to confirm the following:

### Professional Identity
- legal name or professional display name  
- professional role (e.g., Mortgage Professional, Realtor)  
- primary market or service area  
- defined niche or focus (if applicable)

Accuracy here is critical.  
This becomes the foundation for everything downstream.

---

### Business Details
- business or brand name (if used publicly)  
- primary business address (or service-area designation)  
- primary phone number  
- primary email address  

These details must match what appears publicly.

---

### Website
- primary website URL (if you have one)

If you do not have a website:
- this is handled during onboarding
- do not create or guess one

---

### Google Business Profile
- confirmed Google Business Profile (GBP)

You do **not** need to manage this yourself during onboarding.  
DGA will guide confirmation and validation.

---

### Core Professional Profiles
- LinkedIn profile URL  
- Facebook business page URL (if applicable)

Only include profiles you actively use and represent you professionally.

---

## 5. Voice Blueprint (VBP) Preparation

During onboarding, DGA will capture your **Voice Blueprint**.

Be prepared to:
- speak naturally about your work
- explain how you help people
- describe how you typically communicate

This is not a branding exercise.  
It’s about preserving **how you actually sound**.

---

## 6. Additional Requirements for PB Subscribers (MP Only)

If you are a Playbook subscriber, you may also prepare:

### Referral Partner Information
- partner name  
- professional role  
- primary market  
- core professional profiles  

Each referral partner is onboarded as a **clean, independent sub-account**.

---

## 7. Common Mistakes to Avoid

Avoid:
- guessing URLs or profile links  
- using outdated or unused profiles  
- mixing personal and professional information  
- rushing through intake “to get started”

Errors here create friction later.

---

## 8. What Happens After Intake Is Complete

Once intake is complete:
- your account is activated
- audits can begin
- content creation can be scheduled
- publishing systems can operate correctly

Nothing starts before intake is finished.

---

## 9. What to Do If Something Is Missing

If you are unsure about any item:
- pause onboarding
- clarify or confirm the information
- reach out for guidance if needed

It is better to wait than to correct later.

---

## 10. Final Notes

Intake is not busywork.  
It is the **foundation** of the entire DGA system.

Clean inputs create:
- clearer audits
- stronger content
- better long-term outcomes
