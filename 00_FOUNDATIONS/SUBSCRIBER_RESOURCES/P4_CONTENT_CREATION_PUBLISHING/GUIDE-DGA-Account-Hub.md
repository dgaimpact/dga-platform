## 1. Purpose of This Guide

This guide explains **what the DGA Account Hub is**, what information it provides, and how it fits into the overall DGA system.

It exists to:
- give you clear visibility into execution
- eliminate “what’s happening?” uncertainty
- provide transparency without creating management work
- centralize snapshots and optional content access

The Account Hub is about **clarity**, not control.

---

## 2. When to Use This Guide

Use this guide:
- after your account becomes active
- when reviewing what has been published
- when checking status during a content cycle
- when explaining DGA execution to a partner or colleague

Do not use this guide:
- as a task manager
- as a publishing tool
- as a place to request changes
- as a performance dashboard

## 3. What This Guide Is (and Is Not)

### What This Guide *Is*
- a read-only visibility layer
- a historical snapshot of execution
- a reference for what has run and when

### What This Guide *Is Not*
- a CRM
- a content editor
- a posting platform
- a workflow system

---

## 4. What the Account Hub Shows

The Account Hub provides:
- current audit status
- content published during the current cycle
- historical snapshots by 30-day cycle
- links to long-form authority content
- visibility into required platform execution

It shows **what has happened**, not what you need to do.

---

## 5. Optional Platform Content Lives Here (Only)

Any **optional platform content** created during a 30-day cycle:
- is surfaced **only** in the Account Hub
- is grouped by cycle
- is provided for optional use, not obligation
- is not pulled from social platforms

This prevents:
- platform confusion
- version drift
- “which post is correct?” questions

The Account Hub is the **single source of truth** for optional content.

---

## 6. Why the Account Hub Is Read-Only

The Account Hub is intentionally read-only to:
- prevent accidental changes
- protect execution integrity
- reduce management burden
- maintain governance discipline

Visibility builds trust.  
Control introduces friction.

---

## 7. How the Account Hub Supports Relationship Continuity

By showing:
- what has been executed
- when it ran
- how consistency is being maintained

…the Account Hub supports confidence and continuity without constant check-ins.

It answers questions **before they need to be asked**.

---

## 8. Account Hub for PB Subscribers (MP Only)

For PB subscribers, the Account Hub also provides:
- visibility into REA sub-account execution
- high-level snapshots without admin responsibility
- confirmation that relationships remain visible and supported

Oversight without micromanagement is intentional.

---

## 9. What to Do (and Not Do) With the Account Hub

You should:
- use it to stay informed
- reference it during conversations
- trust it as the execution record

You should not:
- attempt to manage posting
- compare cycles competitively
- request ad-hoc changes based on snapshots
- treat it as a performance scorecard

---

## 10. What the Account Hub Does *Not* Measure

The Account Hub does **not** measure:
- engagement
- reach
- leads
- conversion

It shows execution — not outcomes.

---

## 11. Final Notes

The Account Hub exists to:
- make execution visible
- reduce uncertainty
- protect focus
- support calm, confident continuity

You don’t need to “check in” constantly.  
The work is already visible.
