## 4. What the DGA Trust Network Actually Is

The **DGA Trust Network** is a **public layer of professional validation**.

It confirms that:
- you are a real, verified professional
- your presence is consistent and structured
- your authority content is part of a governed system
- your participation is ongoing and maintained

It does not ask the public to judge you.  
It confirms that you are **verifiable and credible**.

---

## 5. Why Public Validation Matters

Public validation:
- reduces uncertainty for humans
- reinforces legitimacy for AI systems
- supports referral confidence
- helps confirm “this professional is real and consistent”

Trust forms more easily when verification is simple.

## 6. How the Trust Network Supports GEO and AIO

The Trust Network supports visibility by:
- reinforcing **GEO** through external confirmation
- supporting **AIO** by validating authoritative sources
- reducing ambiguity across identity signals

It strengthens confidence without requiring activity.

---

## 7. What the Trust Network Is *Not* Designed to Do

The Trust Network is **not** designed to:
- generate leads
- collect or display reviews
- rank professionals
- compare performance
- encourage public engagement

Promotion creates noise.  
Verification creates confidence.

---

## 8. How the Trust Network Works With Other DGA Systems

The Trust Network:
- references Authority Hub content without duplicating it
- aligns with Account Hub execution snapshots
- supports relationship continuity quietly
- remains independent of social platforms

It is a **supporting layer**, not a destination.

---

## 9. Trust Network and Referral Relationships (PB Only)

For PB subscribers:
- the Trust Network reinforces referral credibility
- relationships are publicly verifiable without exposure
- neither partner is promoted over the other

This makes referrals:
- easier to explain
- easier to trust
- less dependent on personal endorsement alone

---

## 10. What to Expect (and What Not to Expect)

### What to Expect
- quiet, consistent public validation
- reinforced credibility over time
- reduced friction in trust-building
- support without self-promotion

### What Not to Expect
- public profiles optimized for traffic

The Trust Network is meant to feel **neutral and calm**.

---

## 11. Final Notes

The DGA Trust Network exists so that:
- credibility is visible without being advertised
- trust is reinforced without pressure
- verification replaces persuasion

You do not need to prove yourself repeatedly.  
Your presence is already confirmed.
