## 1. Purpose of This Guide

This guide explains **how DGA’s content system actually works**, what each layer is responsible for, and what you should — and should not — expect from content execution.

It exists to:
- clarify the role of long-form vs short-form content
- explain how audits drive content decisions
- reset common social media assumptions
- show how visibility is created without daily activity

DGA content exists to **support recognition**, not attention.

---

## 2. When to Use This Guide

Use this guide:
- after reviewing audit results
- before your first content cycle
- when wondering “why this content?”
- when comparing DGA to traditional social media strategies

Do not use this guide:
- to request ad-hoc posting
- to chase trends or news cycles
- to measure engagement or activity volume

---

## 3. What This Guide Is (and Is Not)

### What This Guide *Is*
- an explanation of the full DGA content architecture
- a map of how authority and reinforcement work together
- a guardrail against social media overvaluation

### What This Guide *Is Not*
- a content calendar
- a posting schedule
- a social media growth plan
- a marketing playbook

---

## 4. How Audit Insight Drives Content

All content decisions begin with audit insight.

Audits identify:
- GEO clarity gaps (entity definition and consistency)
- AIO gaps (explanation and authority support)
- areas where reinforcement is needed
- places where stability matters more than change

Content exists to **respond to audit truth**, not ideas or inspiration.

---

## 5. The Role of the Omni-Channel Growth Framework (OCGF)

OCGF governs **how content is structured and connected**, not just where it appears.

It ensures:
- one durable authority layer anchors visibility
- supporting content reinforces the same signals
- platforms work together instead of fragmenting identity
- repetition builds recognition over time

OCGF reduces noise by design.

---

## 6. The Authority Hub — Long-Form Authority Only

The **DGA Authority Hub** is the **primary, long-term home for long-form authority content only**.

It exists to:
- house durable explanations of your expertise
- act as a stable reference layer for AI systems
- remain independent of social platforms
- preserve authority even as platforms change

Important clarification:
- the Authority Hub is **not** used for short-form or social posting
- it is not a content feed
- it is not designed for frequent updates

Content here is written to last.

---

## 7. Managed Posting & Short-Form Reinforcement

Short-form and platform-specific content is handled through a **managed posting system**.

This layer:
- reinforces long-form authority
- maintains consistency across required platforms
- executes without manual effort from you
- may change tools over time without affecting structure

The platform itself is **replaceable**.  
The structure is not.

You are not expected to log in, post, or manage this layer.

---

## 8. The Account Hub — Visibility, Snapshots, and Optional Content

The **Account Hub** is your **single source of truth** for content activity.

It provides:
- snapshots of what has been published
- visibility into execution status
- historical reference by cycle
- access to **optional platform content** for each 30-day cycle

Critical distinction:
- optional platform content is surfaced **only** in the Account Hub
- it is not pulled from social platforms
- it exists for clarity and optional use, not obligation

The Account Hub shows **what happened**, not what you need to do.

---

## 9. How Voice Blueprint Is Applied

All content — long-form and short-form — follows your **Voice Blueprint**.

This ensures:
- explanations sound like you
- tone remains consistent across platforms
- content feels human, not automated
- recognition builds through familiarity

Voice consistency is enforced quietly in the background.

---

## 10. What to Expect (and What Not to Expect)

DGA’s approach intentionally differs from traditional social media strategies.

---

### What to Expect

You should expect:
- a focused presence on mandatory, high-signal platforms
- content structured for **AI visibility**, not engagement
- consistency without constant activity
- minimal time spent managing platforms
- content that works quietly in the background

DGA supports visibility **without consuming your attention**.

---

### What Not to Expect

You should not expect:
- daily posting requirements
- pressure to comment, like, or engage constantly
- time spent scrolling social platforms
- presence on every platform “just in case”
- content designed for entertainment or reach metrics

Being busy on social media is not the same as being visible.

---

## 11. How DGA Views Social Platforms

Within DGA:
- social platforms are **supporting surfaces**, not the foundation
- presence matters more than activity
- structure matters more than frequency
- clarity matters more than engagement

Social platforms reinforce authority.  
They do not create it.

---

## 12. Content Cadence and Volume

Content cadence is:
- deliberate
- consistent
- audit-informed

More content does not create recognition.  
Better structure does.

---

## 13. Content and Referral Relationships (PB Only)

For PB subscribers:
- MP and REA content remains distinct
- authority is aligned, not duplicated
- visibility reinforces credibility on both sides

No partner competes for attention.

---

## 14. Final Notes

DGA’s content system is designed to:
- compound clarity
- reduce distraction
- protect consistency
- support long-term recognition

You are not asked to “show up everywhere.”  
You are supported so you can **show up clearly**.
