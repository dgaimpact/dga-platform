## 1. Purpose of This Guide

This guide explains **how the DGA audit process unfolds over time**, from your first baseline audit through ongoing reviews.

It exists to:
- set expectations around timing and cadence
- explain why audits are not reactive
- clarify how audits guide content and structure
- prevent misinterpretation of short-term change

Audits are designed to observe **direction**, not chase noise.

---

## 2. When to Use This Guide

Use this guide:
- after completing onboarding
- when reviewing your first audit
- when new audits are released
- when wondering “why nothing changed yet”

Do not use this guide:
- to time short-term outcomes
- to judge success month-to-month
- to pressure changes between audit cycles

---

## 3. What This Guide Is (and Is Not)

### What This Guide *Is*
- a timeline explanation for DGA audits
- a reference for audit cadence and intent
- a guardrail against overreaction

### What This Guide *Is Not*
- a performance calendar
- a reporting schedule
- a guarantee of progress speed

## 4. Stage 1 — Baseline Audit (Day 00)

The baseline audit establishes **what is true at the moment you enter DGA**.

It captures:
- your current GEO clarity
- your current AIO support signals
- existing consistency gaps
- strengths already in place

The baseline is **not a judgment**.  
It is a starting reference.

---

## 5. Stage 2 — Audit Interpretation & Direction

After the baseline:
- results are reviewed internally
- priorities are identified
- reinforcement areas are selected

No content is created without this step.

Audit insight defines **what comes next**, not activity volume.

---

## 6. Stage 3 — Content & Structure Response

Once direction is set:
- authority content is created
- publishing follows governed structure
- consistency is reinforced across platforms

This stage is intentionally steady, not fast.

Change requires repetition.

---

## 7. Stage 4 — Ongoing Audit Reviews

Subsequent audits:
- observe directional change
- confirm stability or drift
- identify new gaps only when necessary

They are designed to answer:
- “Is recognition strengthening?”
- “Is clarity improving or eroding?”

They are not designed to react to platform fluctuations.

---

## 8. Audit Cadence (What “Regular” Means)

Audits run on a **defined cadence**, not on demand.

This prevents:
- overfitting to short-term behavior
- unnecessary changes
- visibility fragmentation

Consistency beats frequency.

---

## 9. Why Audits Are Not Reactive

Reactive audits:
- amplify noise
- create unnecessary change
- undermine recognition signals

DGA audits are spaced intentionally to allow:
- content to settle
- signals to repeat
- systems to recognize patterns

Stability creates confidence.

---

## 10. Audit Lifecycle for PB Subscribers

For PB subscribers:
- MP and REA audits follow the same lifecycle
- identities are reviewed independently
- alignment is observed without blending

This ensures:
- balanced visibility
- preserved independence
- credible referral reinforcement

---

## 11. What to Expect (and What Not to Expect)

You should expect:
- gradual, observable direction
- fewer unnecessary changes over time
- clearer understanding of what matters

You should not expect:
- immediate score jumps
- constant updates
- audit-driven urgency

Progress is cumulative.

---

## 12. What to Do Between Audits

Between audits:
- avoid independent “optimizations”
- allow content to do its work
- maintain stability
- flag only material changes

Quiet consistency is a feature, not a bug.

---

## 13. Final Notes

The audit lifecycle exists to:
- protect clarity
- prevent overreaction
- support long-term recognition

Audits are the **compass**, not the engine.
