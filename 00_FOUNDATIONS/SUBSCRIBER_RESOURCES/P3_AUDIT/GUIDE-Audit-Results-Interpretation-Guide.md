## 1. Purpose of This Guide

This guide explains **how to read and understand your audit results**, including GEO and AIO scores, without jumping to conclusions.

It exists to:
- prevent overreaction to individual scores
- explain what scores do and do not represent
- clarify how to use results constructively
- keep focus on direction, not short-term movement

Audit results are **signals**, not verdicts.

---

## 2. When to Use This Guide

Use this guide:
- when reviewing an audit report
- when comparing results across time
- when scores move up or down
- when explaining audit results to a partner

Do not use this guide:
- to judge success or failure
- to compare yourself to others
- to demand immediate changes

## 3. What This Guide Is (and Is Not)

### What This Guide *Is*
- a framework for reading audit outputs calmly
- a reference for understanding score intent
- a guardrail against misinterpretation

### What This Guide *Is Not*
- a performance evaluation
- a KPI dashboard
- a competitive benchmark
- a predictor of outcomes

---

## 4. What Audit Scores Actually Represent

Audit scores represent **confidence signals**, not performance.

They reflect:
- clarity of professional identity (GEO)
- strength of explanatory support (AIO)
- consistency across platforms
- stability over time

Scores summarize **recognition readiness**, not results.

---

## 5. Reading GEO Scores

GEO scores indicate how clearly **you exist as a professional entity**.

Higher GEO suggests:
- consistent identity signals
- clear role and market definition
- alignment across platforms

Lower GEO suggests:
- fragmented identity
- inconsistent naming or positioning
- verification friction

GEO answers:  
**“Is it easy to confirm who this professional is?”**

---

## 6. Reading AIO Scores

AIO scores indicate how well **AI systems can explain your expertise**.

Higher AIO suggests:
- content supports explanation
- expertise is reinforced across sources
- clarity of what you are known for

Lower AIO suggests:
- expertise exists but is thinly supported
- explanations are hard to infer
- content lacks depth or reinforcement

AIO answers:  
**“Is it easy to explain what this professional knows?”**

---

## 7. Why Scores Can Move Without “Anything Changing”

Scores may shift due to:
- new content settling
- signal reinforcement over time
- platform behavior changes
- normal system recalibration

Not every movement reflects action or error.

---

## 8. What Matters More Than Score Changes

More important than individual scores:
- trend direction
- stability over time
- narrowing gaps
- reduced volatility

Flat scores can be healthy.  
Erratic movement is not.

---

## 9. How GEO and AIO Should Be Read Together

GEO and AIO are **equally weighted**.

- Strong GEO + weak AIO = clear identity, weak explanation  
- Strong AIO + weak GEO = strong expertise, weak grounding  
- Strength in both = recognition confidence  

Balance matters more than peaks.

---

## 10. What to Do When Scores Are Lower Than Expected

If scores are lower:
- do not rush changes
- allow content to reinforce naturally
- focus on consistency
- trust the structure

Audit → Content → Reinforcement → Review.

---

## 11. Interpreting Results for PB Subscribers

For PB subscribers:
- MP and REA scores are reviewed independently
- balance matters more than symmetry
- no partner is meant to “outscore” the other

Alignment is structural, not numerical.

---

## 12. Common Interpretation Mistakes to Avoid

Avoid:
- reading scores as grades
- reacting to single data points
- comparing across markets or professions
- assuming cause without trend

Calm interpretation protects progress.

---

## 13. Final Notes

Audit scores exist to **reduce uncertainty**, not create pressure.

Used correctly, they:
- guide reinforcement
- protect stability
- support long-term recognition

Direction beats reaction.
