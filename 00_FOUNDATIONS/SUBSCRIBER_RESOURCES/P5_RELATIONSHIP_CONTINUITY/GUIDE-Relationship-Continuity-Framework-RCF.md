## 1. Purpose of This Guide

It exists to:
- protect the human side of professional relationships
- prevent “automation drift” and over-marketing
- support consistency without pressure
- reinforce trust over time

RCF is about **continuity**, not activity.

- a framework for supporting relationship stability

## 4. The Core Principle of RCF

RCF is built on a simple principle:

> **Strong relationships persist when presence is consistent, credible, and calm.**

RCF focuses on:
- being reliably visible
- remaining professionally clear
- avoiding forced touchpoints
- allowing trust to compound naturally

---

## 5. How RCF Differs From Automation-Based Systems

Traditional systems emphasize:
- frequent touchpoints
- reminders and sequences
- activity metrics
- constant outreach

RCF emphasizes:
- steady professional presence
- durable authority
- quiet reinforcement
- human-led interaction

Silence can be healthy.  
Presence does not require noise.

---

## 6. How RCF Works Within DGA

RCF operates by:
- maintaining consistent professional signals
- reinforcing credibility through content and structure
- ensuring visibility does not decay over time
- surfacing activity transparently in the Account Hub

Relationships stay warm without constant contact.

---

## 7. RCF and Content

Content supports RCF by:
- reminding contacts what you do
- reinforcing expertise passively
- staying discoverable without outreach
- reducing the need for repeated explanation

The content works even when you are not actively engaging.

---

## 8. RCF and Visibility (GEO + AIO)

RCF supports continuity by:
- preserving **GEO** clarity (who you are)
- maintaining **AIO** support (what you’re known for)
- preventing erosion caused by inconsistency or absence

Recognition sustains relationships.

---

## 9. RCF for PB Subscribers (Referral Relationships)

For PB subscribers:
- RCF supports MP–REA relationships without interference
- visibility reinforces trust without pressure
- partners remain top-of-mind without constant check-ins
- credibility stays balanced on both sides

RCF supports relationships — it does not manage them.

---

## 10. What to Expect (and What Not to Expect)

### What to Expect
- relationships that feel supported, not marketed
- reduced pressure to “stay in touch”
- credibility that holds between conversations
- continuity without effort

### What Not to Expect
- automated messages
- forced follow-ups
- activity tracking
- relationship scoring

RCF respects human judgment.

---

## 11. How RCF Protects Long-Term Trust

RCF protects trust by:
- avoiding over-communication
- preventing message fatigue
- keeping visibility consistent
- allowing space for genuine interaction

Trust erodes when contact feels mechanical.

---

## 12. Final Notes

The Relationship Continuity Framework exists so that:
- relationships remain human
- presence stays steady
- credibility compounds quietly
- trust is never rushed

DGA supports continuity —  
you provide the connection.
