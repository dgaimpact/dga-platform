## 1. How to Use This Playbook (Important)

This playbook is **not a task list** and **not a performance system**.

It exists to:
- translate RCF principles into practical behavior
- provide light structure without obligation
- reduce uncertainty about “what to do next”
- protect relationships from over-management

Everything in this playbook is **optional, situational, and human-led**.

If something feels forced, skip it.

## 2. The Three REA Relationship States

Every REA relationship typically sits in one of three states.  
Your actions should depend on the **state**, not the calendar.

---

### State 1 — New Relationship

**What this looks like:**
- early trust
- exploratory conversations
- expectations still forming

**RCF focus:**  
Clarity, calm presence, no pressure.

**What helps:**
- ensuring your professional presence is clear and stable
- letting DGA structure work quietly in the background
- avoiding early over-communication

**What to avoid:**
- frequent check-ins
- “just touching base” messages
- positioning PB as marketing or lead gen

---

### State 2 — Active Relationship

**What this looks like:**
- ongoing referrals or collaboration
- mutual understanding of roles
- natural communication rhythm

**RCF focus:**  
Consistency without interference.

**What helps:**
- staying visible without being noisy
- letting authority and credibility reinforce trust
- maintaining balance between both professional identities

**What to avoid:**
- unnecessary “maintenance” outreach
- automation
- tracking activity as performance

---

### State 3 — Quiet Relationship (Normal)

**What this looks like:**
- fewer conversations
- no recent referrals
- no friction or conflict

**RCF focus:**  
Continuity, not reactivation.

**Important:**  
Quiet does **not** mean broken.

**What helps:**
- steady professional visibility
- content and authority doing background work
- patience

**What to avoid:**
- panic outreach
- forced check-ins
- restarting the relationship unnecessarily

---

## 3. A Light Weekly Rhythm (Optional)

This is **not a requirement**.  
Think of it as a *mental rhythm*, not a checklist.

In a typical week, you might:
- focus on your actual clients and files
- trust that your professional presence remains visible
- avoid unnecessary outreach unless there is a real reason

If no relationship action feels appropriate that week —  
that is normal.

RCF works **between** weeks.

---

## 4. Monthly Visibility Check (Account Hub–Driven)

Once per cycle, you may choose to:
- glance at your Account Hub
- confirm execution is happening
- note that authority and visibility remain consistent

This is about **confidence**, not monitoring.

You are not expected to act on what you see.

---

## 5. When to Reach Out (and When Not To)

### Reach Out When:
- you have something genuinely relevant to share
- there is a real client or situation to discuss
- time has passed and a human check-in feels natural

### Do Not Reach Out When:
- nothing meaningful has changed
- you feel obligated to “do something”
- silence makes you uncomfortable

RCF removes the need for filler communication.

---

## 6. How DGA Supports You Between Touchpoints

Between conversations, DGA:
- maintains your professional clarity
- reinforces your expertise quietly
- ensures you remain easy to refer to
- prevents visibility decay

This is why silence is safe.

---

## 7. Common Mistakes That Weaken Relationships

Avoid:
- turning PB into a talking point
- explaining systems instead of value
- over-checking visibility
- treating relationships as pipelines
- forcing cadence where none is needed

Trust erodes when relationships feel managed.

---

## 8. Introducing PB to an REA (Simple Framing)

If needed, simple framing works best:

- “This just supports consistency.”
- “Nothing you need to manage.”
- “No posting or activity required.”
- “It keeps things steady in the background.”

If it requires a long explanation, it’s probably too much.

---

## 9. What This Playbook Intentionally Does *Not* Include

This playbook does **not** include:
- scripts
- quotas
- follow-up schedules
- automation rules
- performance expectations

Those things belong to sales systems — not relationships.

---

## 10. Final Notes

The goal of PB Relationship Continuity is simple:

- stay credible
- stay visible
- stay human
- stay calm

When relationships are ready to move, they will.

DGA keeps the foundation steady.  
You decide when to step forward.
