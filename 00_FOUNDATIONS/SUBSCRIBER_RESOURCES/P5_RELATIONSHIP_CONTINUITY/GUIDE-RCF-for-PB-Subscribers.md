## 1. Purpose of This Guide

This guide explains **how PB subscribers should use the Relationship Continuity Framework (RCF)** to support Realtor (REA) referral relationships in a way that feels natural, professional, and human.

It exists to:

RCF supports relationships.  
It never replaces them.

## 3. What This Guide Is (and Is Not)

### What This Guide *Is*
- a relationship support framework
- a visibility-first continuity model
- a guardrail against transactional behavior

### What This Guide *Is Not*
- a CRM workflow
- a follow-up automation system
- a referral quota model
- a sales enablement playbook

---

## 4. The Core Principle of RCF for PB

RCF for PB is built on one principle:

> **Strong referral relationships persist when credibility is visible even when conversation is not constant.**

The goal is to:
- remain professionally present
- reinforce trust quietly
- reduce the need to “check in”
- let relationships breathe

---

## 5. Your Role vs DGA’s Role

### Your Role (Human)
You remain responsible for:
- the relationship itself
- communication style and frequency
- trust, chemistry, and fit
- knowing when to reach out — and when not to

RCF never automates this.

---

### DGA’s Role (Structural)
DGA supports continuity by:
- maintaining your professional visibility
- reinforcing your authority and clarity
- ensuring your presence does not decay over time
- supporting your REA partner’s visibility independently

DGA works **between conversations**.

---

## 6. How RCF Supports REA Relationships in Practice

RCF helps by ensuring that:
- your expertise remains easy to verify
- your role stays clear and consistent
- your REA partner can confidently refer to you
- your presence feels stable, not sales-driven

This reduces friction during real conversations.

---

## 7. Using PB RCF During REA Onboarding

When introducing PB to an REA:
- position it as **support**, not promotion
- explain that their identity remains fully theirs
- clarify there are no posting requirements
- emphasize visibility without pressure

PB should feel like reinforcement — not marketing.

---

## 8. What to Do When a Relationship Goes Quiet

Silence does not mean decline.

RCF is designed so that:
- your visibility remains steady
- credibility does not erode
- trust stays intact between interactions

When you do reach out, you are not restarting from zero.

---

## 9. What RCF Prevents (By Design)

RCF intentionally avoids:
- forced check-ins
- automated messages
- “just touching base” outreach
- activity-based relationship scoring

Relationships weaken when they feel managed.

---

## 10. RCF and Content for PB Subscribers

Content supports RCF by:
- reinforcing expertise passively
- giving REAs confidence in referring clients
- reducing the need to repeatedly explain what you do
- keeping your role top-of-mind without outreach

Content works **in the background**.

---

## 11. RCF and Visibility Balance (MP + REA)

RCF ensures that:
- MP and REA authority remains distinct
- neither partner overshadows the other
- visibility supports mutual credibility
- alignment never becomes competition

Balance is structural, not negotiated.

---

## 12. What to Expect (and What Not to Expect)

### What to Expect
- relationships that feel supported, not pushed
- fewer awkward outreach moments
- trust that holds between conversations
- easier referrals over time

### What Not to Expect
- automated referrals
- guaranteed volume
- performance tracking
- replacement for real communication

---

## 13. How to Use RCF Well

RCF works best when you:
- respect the relationship
- trust the structure
- avoid over-intervention
- stay human

Let visibility do the quiet work.

---

## 14. Final Notes

RCF for PB exists so that:
- referral relationships stay human
- credibility remains visible
- trust compounds without pressure
- support replaces hustle

DGA keeps you present.  
You keep the relationship real.
