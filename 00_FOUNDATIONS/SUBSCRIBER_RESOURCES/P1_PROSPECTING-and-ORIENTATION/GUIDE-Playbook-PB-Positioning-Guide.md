## 1. Purpose of This Guide

This guide explains **how Playbook (PB) is meant to be positioned and used** in real referral relationships.

It exists to:
- clarify what PB is designed to do
- prevent PB from being misused as marketing or lead gen
- help you introduce PB to referral partners with confidence
- protect trust on both sides of the relationship

PB works best when expectations are clear from the start.

---

## 2. When to Use This Guide

Use this guide:
- before introducing PB to a Realtor partner
- when explaining PB during a referral conversation
- when evaluating whether PB fits a specific relationship
- when resetting expectations if a relationship feels misaligned

Do not use this guide:
- as a sales script
- as a pressure tool
- as a promise of referrals or outcomes

---

## 3. What This Guide Is (and Is Not)

### What This Guide *Is*
- a positioning reference for real conversations
- a framework for explaining PB clearly and calmly
- a trust-protection tool

### What This Guide *Is Not*
- a marketing pitch
- a recruiting funnel
- a performance guarantee
- a replacement for real relationship work

---

## 4. The Core Problem PB Solves

Referral relationships often fade not because of intent — but because of:
- inconsistency
- invisibility
- lack of shared structure
- uneven effort over time

PB exists to **make good relationships visible, consistent, and durable** — without adding admin work or pressure.

---

## 5. What Playbook Actually Is

Playbook is a **relationship-support system** built on top of the Solo (SO) foundation.

It provides:
- clean onboarding for referral partners
- aligned visibility and authority content
- shared credibility through structure
- transparency without micromanagement

PB strengthens what already exists.  
It does not manufacture relationships.

---

## 6. What Playbook Is Not

Playbook is **not**:
- a lead-generation program
- a referral automation system
- a way to “lock in” partners
- a tactic to demand reciprocity

If a relationship requires pressure, PB is the wrong tool.

---

## 7. How to Position PB With Referral Partners

Use simple, human language.

Examples:
- “This isn’t about marketing — it’s about keeping our professional presence aligned.”  
- “It helps make sure we both show up clearly and consistently.”  
- “There’s no obligation. It just supports how we already work together.”

Avoid language like:
- “This will get you more leads.”
- “This guarantees referrals.”
- “This replaces your marketing.”

---

## 8. What PB Provides to Referral Partners

From the partner’s perspective, PB:
- supports their professional visibility
- keeps their presence consistent
- reinforces credibility without effort
- aligns them with a trusted professional ecosystem

They are not being marketed *through*.  
They are being **supported alongside**.

---

## 9. Your Role as a PB Subscriber

As the MP:
- you own the relationship
- you introduce PB thoughtfully
- you set the tone and expectations
- you decide which relationships fit

DGA supports the structure —  
**you** maintain the trust.

---

## 10. When PB Is a Good Fit (and When It’s Not)

PB works well when:
- the relationship is already healthy
- both sides value consistency
- trust already exists

PB is not a fit when:
- the relationship is transactional
- referrals are one-sided or forced
- expectations are misaligned

---

## 11. What to Do Next

If you are considering PB for a relationship:
- reflect on the quality of the partnership
- review the **Relationship Continuity Overview**
- introduce PB only where it naturally fits

If PB is already active:
- use this guide to keep positioning aligned
- focus on consistency, not activity

---

## 12. Final Notes

Playbook exists to **protect good relationships from fading**, not to turn them into systems.

When positioned correctly:
- it feels supportive
- it stays human
- it compounds trust over time
