- what each plan is designed to do  
- who each plan is best suited for  
- how value is created over time  
- where responsibility and leverage differ

- when explaining DGA to a colleague or partner
- when reassessing whether your current plan still fits your goals

---

## 3. What This Guide Is (and Is Not)

### What This Guide *Is*
- a plain-language comparison of SO and PB
- an explanation of how each plan creates leverage
- a decision-support reference

### What This Guide *Is Not*
- a sales pitch
- a performance forecast
- a guarantee of referrals or results

---

## 4. The Shared Foundation (Applies to Both SO and PB)

All DGA subscriptions operate on the **same core system**.

Both SO and PB include:
- structured intake and onboarding
- ongoing visibility audits
- governed content creation and publishing
- a primary home for authority content
- public trust and validation layers
- clear visibility into execution through the Account Hub

PB does **not** replace SO.  
PB **builds on it**.

## 5. Solo (SO) — Who It’s For and What It Does

### Who SO Is For
SO is designed for professionals who want to:
- strengthen their individual visibility
- build long-term authority
- stay recognizable and consistent
- avoid managing multiple platforms themselves

### What SO Focuses On
- your personal professional presence  
- clarity of role, market, and niche  
- durable authority over time  

### How Value Is Created
Value compounds through:
- consistent identity signals
- structured authority content
- stable publishing discipline
- ongoing visibility monitoring

SO is **infrastructure** for your professional presence.

## 6. Playbook (PB) — Who It’s For and What It Adds *(MP Only)*

### Who PB Is For
PB is designed for Mortgage Professionals who:
- rely on referral relationships
- want those relationships to stay visible and credible
- want alignment without managing partners day-to-day

### What PB Adds
PB extends the SO foundation by adding:
- structured support for referral partners (REAs)
- clean onboarding for REA sub-accounts
- aligned content that reinforces both sides of the relationship
- visibility into partner activity without admin work

### How Value Is Created
Value is created through:
- visible, credible referral relationships
- consistency across partner entities
- reduced relationship drift
- stronger confidence for both humans and AI systems

PB is **relationship leverage**, not marketing.

---

## 7. A Simple Comparison

### Solo (SO)
- focused on *you*
- builds individual authority
- no partner management
- ideal for single-entity visibility

### Playbook (PB)
- focused on *relationships*
- builds aligned authority across partners
- supports referral ecosystems
- ideal for professionals who grow through partnerships

---

## 8. What PB Is Not

PB is not:
- a lead-generation program
- a referral automation system
- a way to pressure partners
- a replacement for real relationships

PB exists to **support relationships**, not manufacture them.

---

## 9. How to Decide Which Plan Fits

SO may be the right fit if:
- your focus is your own visibility
- you do not actively manage referral partners
- you want a strong, independent foundation

PB may be the right fit if:
- referrals are central to your business
- you value long-term partner alignment
- you want visibility and consistency without micromanagement

---

## 10. What to Do Next

If you are deciding:
- review the **DGA Orientation Overview**
- consider how your business actually grows
- choose the plan that matches your reality

If you are already subscribed:
- use this guide to confirm alignment
- move on to plan-specific resources as needed

---

## 11. Final Notes

DGA is designed around **structure, consistency, and durability**.

The right plan is not about ambition —  
it’s about **how you actually create value in the real world**.
