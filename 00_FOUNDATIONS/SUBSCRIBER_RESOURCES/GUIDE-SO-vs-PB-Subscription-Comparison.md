## 1. Purpose of This Guide

This guide explains **what SO and PB subscriptions include, how they differ, and what is (and is not) expected** from subscribers in each tier.

It exists to:
- eliminate confusion between plans
- set clean expectations
- prevent incorrect assumptions about access
- clarify where PB extends (not replaces) SO

SO and PB share the **same system foundation**.  
PB extends relationship scope.

---

## 2. What SO and PB Have in Common (Important)

Both subscriptions include **full access** to:

- the complete DGA pillar system (P1–P5)
- structured intake and onboarding
- GEO + AIO visibility audits
- long-form authority content (Authority Hub)
- short-form reinforcement via managed posting
- Voice Blueprint governance
- Account Hub (read-only execution visibility)
- Trust Network (public professional validation)
- calm, non-reactive cadence and governance

There is **no restricted access tier** inside DGA.

---

## 3. SO — Solo Subscription

### Who SO Is For
- professionals focused on **their own authority**
- single professional identity
- clarity, credibility, and durability as the goal

---

### What SO Includes

- one professional entity
- one Authority Hub presence
- GEO + AIO audits for that entity
- managed platform reinforcement
- full access to the Account Hub
- inclusion in the DGA Trust Network

SO subscribers are fully visible and verifiable.

---

### What SO Does *Not* Include

- referral partner onboarding
- sub-accounts
- relationship continuity tooling for partners
- oversight of other professionals

SO is intentionally **focused**, not limited.

---

### SO Subscriber Responsibilities

- provide accurate intake information
- participate in Voice Blueprint creation
- maintain stability in professional identity
- allow the system to operate without interference

No posting, engagement, or platform management is required.

---

## 4. PB — Playbook Subscription

### Who PB Is For
- Mortgage Professionals working with **REA referral partners**
- those managing relationship complexity
- those who want structure without management burden

---

### What PB Includes (In Addition to SO)

Everything in SO, **plus**:

- onboarding of REA referral partners as sub-accounts
- independent authority support for each REA
- visibility into REA execution via Account Hub
- Relationship Continuity Framework (RCF) support
- PB Relationship Continuity Playbook

PB expands **relationship scope**, not platform access.

---

### What PB Does *Not* Include

- control over REA content or activity
- referral automation
- exclusivity enforcement
- partner performance tracking

PB supports relationships —  
it does not manage people.

---

### PB Subscriber Responsibilities

- maintain the human relationship
- introduce PB calmly and accurately
- respect partner independence
- avoid over-intervention

DGA handles structure.  
You handle trust.

---

## 5. Authority Hub: SO vs PB

**SO**
- one Authority Hub presence
- content focused solely on your expertise

**PB**
- separate Authority Hub presence for each entity
- MP and REA content never merged
- authority aligned structurally, not blended

---

## 6. Account Hub: SO vs PB

**Both SO and PB**
- have full read-only access to their Account Hub
- see audits, content activity, and execution snapshots
- access optional platform content by cycle

**PB Only**
- also sees high-level snapshots of REA sub-accounts
- no admin or management controls

Visibility without responsibility is intentional.

---

## 7. Trust Network: SO vs PB

**Both SO and PB**
- are included in the DGA Trust Network
- receive public professional validation
- benefit from verification and credibility signals

**PB**
- extends Trust Network validation across MP–REA relationships
- reinforces referral credibility without promotion

Trust is shared — not tiered.

---

## 8. Content Expectations (Both Plans)

You should expect:
- fewer platforms, used intentionally
- structure over frequency
- calm, deliberate cadence
- no social media busywork

You should not expect:
- daily posting
- engagement requirements
- trend chasing
- platform experimentation

Both plans follow the same content philosophy.

---

## 9. Relationship Continuity (Key Difference)

**SO**
- continuity is individual and passive
- focused on credibility over time

**PB**
- continuity extends to referral relationships
- supported by RCF and the PB Playbook
- designed to keep trust intact between conversations

PB exists because relationships add complexity —  
not because they need automation.

---

## 10. Choosing Between SO and PB

Choose **SO** if:
- your focus is personal authority
- you do not manage referral partners
- simplicity fits your reality

Choose **PB** if:
- referral relationships are core to your business
- balance and independence matter
- you want support without management overhead

---

## 11. Final Notes

SO and PB are not “better” or “worse.”

They are:
- different in scope
- identical in access
- aligned in philosophy

Both are designed to:
- reduce distraction
- protect credibility
- support long-term outcomes

Choose the scope that matches your relationships —  
not the one you think you *should* have.
