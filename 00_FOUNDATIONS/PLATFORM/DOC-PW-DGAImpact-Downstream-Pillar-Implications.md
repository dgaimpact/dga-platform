## Purpose

This document maps the **approved DGAImpact.com Platform Definition** to **explicit downstream implications** across each DGA operational pillar.

Its purpose is to:

* prevent misinterpretation during execution
* clarify what *does* and *does not* change in each pillar
* identify required confirmations, constraints, and no-go zones

This document does **not** introduce new behavior.

## P1 — Prospecting

### What Is Reinforced

* Education-first positioning remains mandatory
* Prospecting content on the DGA Public Site is limited to:

  * GEO
  * AIO
  * Omni-Presence
  * AI visibility systems
* Profession-neutral entry with profession-specific routing is valid

### What Changes

* Prospect education can now explicitly reference:

  * DGA Authority Hub (as proof layer)
  * DGA Trust Network (as corroboration layer)

### What Is Prohibited

* No profession-, niche-, or market-specific advisory content
* No local competitive positioning against account holders
* No execution promises inferred from website analytics

### Action Check

* Confirm P1 content inventory aligns with meta-only rule

---

## P2 — Intake & Onboarding

### What Is Reinforced

* Website does not create or normalize entities
* Intake remains authoritative only when completed via P2 systems

### What Changes

* Intake references may surface:

  * future Authority Hub presence
  * future Trust Network listing
* Account numbers become the **sole access key** for Account Hub visibility

### What Is Prohibited

* No activation logic on the website
* No partial or provisional accounts surfaced publicly

### Action Check

* Confirm intake schemas explicitly distinguish:

  * subscriber vs professional account holder
  * primary vs sub-account

---

## P3 — Audit

### What Is Reinforced

* Audit remains the single source of truth
* Audit → Content remains strictly one-way

### What Changes

* Audit outputs are now *explicitly consumable* by:

  * Authority Hub (public proof)
  * Account Hub (private visibility)

### What Is Prohibited

* No audit triggering via website state
* No interpretation or delta logic displayed beyond approved summaries

### Action Check

* Confirm audit display language remains observational

---

## P4 — Content Creation & Publishing

### What Is Reinforced

* Authority Hub is the canonical publishing destination
* All professional, niche, and market content lives here

### What Changes

* Clear separation between:

  * DGA-authored meta content (Public Site)
  * Account-holder authority content (Authority Hub)
* Trust Network may UTM-link into Authority Hub artifacts

### What Is Prohibited

* No content execution controls on the website
* No subscriber-directed publishing discretion

### Action Check

* Confirm content pipelines target Authority Hub by default

---

## P5 — Relationship Continuity

### What Is Reinforced

* Website does not replace human presence
* Continuity remains human-led

### What Changes

* Account Hub provides **visibility support** for conversations:

  * what was published
  * what is upcoming
  * what platforms are mandatory vs optional

### What Is Prohibited

* No automated outreach based on website activity
* No performance scoring inferred from analytics

### Action Check

* Confirm Account Hub is visibility-only

---

## Cross-Pillar Locks

The following are now **explicitly locked**:

* Website is reflection-only
* No execution, triggering, or control logic
* Public authority vs professional authority separation
* Analytics are directional, not causal
* Profession expansion governed upstream, not via website

---

## Lock Statement

This mapping exists to ensure that **implementation never outruns intent**.

If a proposed change touches more than one pillar, it must be reviewed against this document *before* execution.
