**Created:** 2025-12-14
**Status:** Referential (System-of-Record for Platform Interpretation)

Applies To: DGA Core Platform

## 1. Purpose

This document defines **what dgaimpact.com is and is not** within the Digital Growth Accelerator (DGA) ecosystem.

It exists to:

* establish a single, human-readable platform interpretation before technical rebuilds
* prevent system drift, feature creep, and role confusion
* align website structure with the locked DGA Business Model and Pillar architecture
* serve as the authoritative reference for future implementation decisions

This document is **descriptive, not governing**.

If a conflict arises:

* the DGA Business Model
* Pillar Lock Reference
* or governing Blueprints

override this document.

---

## 2. What dgaimpact.com Is

dgaimpact.com is a **multi-surface, read-only platform layer** that:

* supports prospect education and intake
* publishes governed authority content
* provides public corroboration of professional entities
* offers private visibility into account-level execution state

The website **does not execute system behavior**.

It reflects truth defined elsewhere in the DGA system (GitHub governance, audits, execution pipelines) and exists to make that truth observable to humans and AI systems.

If dgaimpact.com were unavailable temporarily, DGA’s underlying systems would continue to operate.

---

## 3. What dgaimpact.com Is Not

dgaimpact.com is explicitly **not**:

* a system of record
* a CRM
* an automation trigger
* an audit engine
* a content execution system
* a publishing controller
* a relationship management tool

The website never initiates, triggers, or controls downstream behavior.

---

## 4. Platform Architecture Overview

dgaimpact.com consists of **four distinct surfaces**, unified by domain but separated by purpose, authority, and access rules.

These surfaces may share branding and infrastructure, but they do not share responsibility.

---

## 5. Surface 1 — DGA Public Site

### Purpose

* educate the market on GEO, AIO, Omni‑Presence, and AI visibility systems
* qualify prospects
* route Mortgage Professionals (MPs) and Real Estate Agents (REAs) into profession‑specific education paths
* support consultation booking and waitlist creation

### Content Rules

* content is **meta‑level only**
* allowed topics:

  * GEO
  * AIO
  * AI visibility systems
  * ecosystem evolution
  * platform best practices
* forbidden topics:

  * profession‑specific advice
  * niche‑specific strategies
  * market‑specific guidance

### Search Posture

* the DGA Public Site may compete **only at the DGA category level**
* it must never compete locally with professional account holders

## 6. Surface 2 — DGA Authority Hub (Public)

### Purpose

### Authority Ownership

### Discoverability

* fully public
* fully indexable

### Boundary Rule

* it never functions as a dashboard or execution surface

---

## 7. Surface 3 — DGA Trust Network (Public)

* no sales language

---

## 8. Surface 4 — DGA Account Hub (Private)

### Purpose

* support clarity, confidence, and planning

### Access

* account‑number gated
* URL‑accessible
* blocked from indexing

### Available Information

## 9. Analytics & Measurement Philosophy

Analytics across dgaimpact.com exist to:

1. demonstrate system activity and visibility signals
2. support narrative understanding of momentum
3. provide internal early‑warning indicators

Analytics must never:

* imply causation
* guarantee outcomes
* attribute revenue or leads

Language must remain observational and directional.

---

## 10. Governance & Change Control

Changes to dgaimpact.com require:

* impact review against the DGA Business Model
* confirmation of Pillar ownership boundaries
* alignment with this platform definition

Incremental convenience changes are prohibited.

Repeated feature requests must be evaluated for system impact before approval.

---

## 11. Lock Statement

This document exists to preserve clarity as DGA scales.

The website is a **reflection layer**, not a control layer.

When interpretation drifts, execution degrades.
