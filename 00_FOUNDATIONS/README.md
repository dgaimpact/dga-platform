# 00_FOUNDATIONS  
### Core Concepts, Definitions, and Strategic Foundations for the DGA Platform

---

## Purpose

The **00_FOUNDATIONS** directory contains the **bedrock concepts** that everything in the DGA ecosystem is built on.

This folder answers:

- What is DGA?
- Who is it for?
- How does it create value?
- What principles and definitions never change even as systems evolve?

Everything else in the repo (frameworks, systems, workflows, automations, prompt libraries) is expected to align with what’s documented here.

---

## Scope

Documents in this folder define:

- The DGA **business model** and value architecture  
- Core terminology and definitions used across the platform  
- Target users and ecosystem roles (e.g., professionals, partners)  
- Non-negotiable principles and constraints  
- High-level positioning and differentiation  

If a concept is “foundational” and applies everywhere, it belongs here.

---

## Current Contents

Examples of files you may find here:

- `business-model.md`  
  - High-level overview of how DGA creates, delivers, and captures value.

Future additions could include:

- `glossary.md`  
- `positioning-statement.md`  
- `target-audiences.md`  
- `principles-and-constraints.md`  
- `dga-philosophy.md`

## How This Folder Relates to Other Areas

- **01_FRAMEWORKS**  
  Uses the foundations defined here to build concrete strategic frameworks  
  (Brand Voice, OCGF, GEO/AI Visibility, MP–REA Engagement, etc.).

- **02_OPERATIONS**  
  Executes onboarding and delivery in a way that respects the foundational model.

- **03_SYSTEMS / 04_AUTOMATIONS**  
  Implement technical architectures and workflows that must remain consistent with the core definitions and business model in this folder.

- **08_STACKAI_PROMPT_LIBRARY**  
  All prompts assume the terminology, positioning, and constraints documented in `00_FOUNDATIONS`.

## When to Add or Update Documents Here

Add or edit files in `00_FOUNDATIONS` when:

- You clarify or refine **what DGA is** or **who it serves**.  
- You change or sharpen DGA’s **core offer** or **business structure**.  
- You introduce new foundational terminology that will be used across the repo.  
- You identify principles that should guide all future systems and workflows.

If a change only affects a specific system, workflow, or prompt family, it likely belongs in `01_FRAMEWORKS`, `02_OPERATIONS`, `03_SYSTEMS`, or `08_STACKAI_PROMPT_LIBRARY` instead.

---

## Editing Guidelines

- Keep language **clear and declarative**.  
- Avoid implementation detail — that belongs in systems/workflows, not foundations.  
- When you introduce a term or concept that will appear elsewhere, define it here or link to a document in this folder.  
- Treat this folder as **the reference point** whenever there’s confusion about meaning, scope, or intent.

---

## Status

This folder is **active** and will evolve as DGA’s positioning and ecosystem mature.  
Changes here should be made deliberately, since they can cascade into many other areas of the platform.
