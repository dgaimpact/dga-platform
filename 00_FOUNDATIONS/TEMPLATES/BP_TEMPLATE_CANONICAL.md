## FOUNDER DOCTRINE

This Blueprint documents decisions already made.

It exists to:
- prevent system drift
- constrain interpretation
- protect long-term trust
- ensure execution follows intent

If a downstream system, Execution Doctrine, SOP, or automation conflicts with this Blueprint, the conflict must be resolved here first.

OPTIONAL — INCLUDE ONLY IF DOCUMENT REQUIRES NON-LINEAR NAVIGATION

Criteria:
- 12+ major sections
- multiple conceptual domains

## 1. Purpose & Authority

This document is the **canonical governing authority** for [subject area] within the Digital Growth Accelerator (DGA).

It exists to:
- define intent and boundaries
- constrain interpretation
- prevent downstream drift
- govern how this domain is allowed to operate

This Blueprint governs **intent and boundaries only**.

It does **not** define:
- workflows
- tooling
- automation logic
- schemas or field names
- execution mechanics

Those are defined exclusively in Execution Doctrines, Registries, and SOPs.

## 10. Non-Negotiable Invariants

1. [Invariant]
2. [Invariant]
3. [Invariant]

If a proposal violates an invariant, it is rejected unless this Blueprint is formally revised.

---

## 11. Downstream Enforcement

This Blueprint is enforced through:
- **ED–P# — [Execution Doctrine Name]**
- Schema & State Registries
- Relevant SOPs

Downstream documents must **implement**, not reinterpret, this intent.

---

## 12. Lock Statement

This Blueprint exists to preserve clarity, trust, and intent at scale.

It is not a tactic.  
It is a **design stance**.
