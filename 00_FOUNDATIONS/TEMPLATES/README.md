# Templates — Canonical Document Structures

This directory contains **canonical document templates** used across the DGA platform.

Templates define **structure only**.
They do not define governance, execution logic, or operational behavior.

---

## Purpose

Templates exist to:
- Enforce structural consistency across documents
- Prevent formatting drift as the system scales
- Reduce cognitive load during document creation
- Ensure downstream systems can reliably interpret documents

Templates are **foundational assets** and are never consumed directly by runtime systems.

---

## What Belongs Here

This directory includes templates for:

- **Blueprints (BP)** — governance and intent
- **Execution Doctrines (ED)** — deterministic system behavior
- **Standard Operating Procedures (SOP)** — human workflows
- **General Documents (GD)** — reference and account-level artifacts

Examples:
- `BP_TEMPLATE_CANONICAL_V2.md`
- `ED_TEMPLATE_CANONICAL.md`
- `SOP_TEMPLATE_CA
