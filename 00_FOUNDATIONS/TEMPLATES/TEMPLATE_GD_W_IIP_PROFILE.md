## 1. Purpose

This document defines the structure for a **Web-Derived Information Intake Profile (W-IIP)**.

A W-IIP exists to support **subscriber-facing communications** when an interview-based Information Intake Profile (IIP) is not yet available.

This profile enables DGA to deliver audit summaries, recommendations, and operational messages **without delay**, while remaining fully replaceable once a custom IIP is created.

---

## 2. Scope & Boundaries

### In Scope

* Observable communication preferences inferred from public digital behavior
* Content density and formatting cues present in online materials
* Professional presentation norms visible across assets

### Out of Scope

* Voice, tone, or stylistic expression for public content
* Personality inference beyond delivery preference signals
* Content creation guidance
* Marketing or branding usage

---

## 3. Source Signals

This W-IIP is derived exclusively from **publicly accessible digital assets**, which may include:

* Website structure and formatting
* Blog layout and content density
* Use of headings, bullets, or long-form text
* Call-to-action clarity and sequencing
* Professional profile layouts (e.g., LinkedIn)

Only **explicit, observable delivery patterns** are evaluated. No speculative assumptions are permitted.

## 4. Web-Derived Information Intake Profile

### 4.1 Observed Information Delivery Preferences

High-level summary of how information appears to be structured and presented publicly.

* Preferred detail level:
* Apparent structure preference:
* Pacing and sequencing cues:
* Visual vs text emphasis:

---

### 4.2 Formatting & Structure Tendencies

Observed patterns across reviewed assets:

* Paragraph length: <short / mixed / long>
* Use of bullets or lists: <frequent / occasional / minimal>
* Sectioning and headings: <strong / moderate / minimal>
* Visual aids (charts, graphics): <present / limited / none>

---

### 4.3 Communication Framing Patterns

Common framing approaches identified:

* Step-by-step explanation
* Summary-first, detail-later
* Context-heavy explanation
* Action-oriented directives

---

### 4.4 Derived Delivery Guardrails

**Subscriber Communications SHOULD:**

* Match observed information density and structure
* Respect apparent preference for clarity or depth
* Maintain professional presentation norms

**Subscriber Communications SHOULD NOT:**

* Introduce overly casual or promotional language
* Overwhelm with unnecessary detail
* Assume tone preferences not evidenced online

---

## 5. System Usage Rules

### Permitted Usage

This W-IIP:

* MAY be used for subscriber-facing communications
* MAY be used for audit summaries and recommendations
* EXISTS solely to prevent onboarding and delivery delays

### Prohibited Usage

This W-IIP MUST NOT be used for:

* Public-facing content creation
* Voice modeling or tone inference
* Marketing or Omni-Presence assets

Blending with VBP or W-VBP data is strictly prohibited.

---

## 6. Replacement & Archiving Rules

* A W-IIP remains active **only until** an interview-based IIP is available
* Upon replacement:

  * The W-IIP MUST be archived
  * The interview-based IIP becomes the sole active delivery reference
* No mid-cycle delivery profile switching is permitted

---

## 7. Confidence & Limitation Statement

This W-IIP represents:

* an approximation based on observable delivery signals
* a temporary communication aid
* a non-authoritative preference model

It must always yield to an interview-derived IIP when available.

---

## 8. Change Log

* v1.0 — Initial canonical template aligned to GENERAL_DOCUMENT_TEMPLATE_CANONICAL.md
