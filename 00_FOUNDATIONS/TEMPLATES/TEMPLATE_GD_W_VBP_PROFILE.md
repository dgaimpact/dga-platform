## 1. Purpose

This document defines the structure for a **Web‑Derived Voice Blueprint Profile (W‑VBP)**.

A W‑VBP exists to ensure **content execution continuity** when an interview‑based Voice Blueprint Profile (VBP) is not yet available.

This profile allows DGA audits and content cycles to proceed **without delay**, while remaining fully replaceable once a custom VBP is created.

## 2. Scope & Boundaries

### In Scope

* Observable, public‑facing language patterns
* Tone and stylistic cues expressed in existing digital assets
* Structural communication tendencies

### Out of Scope

* Personality assumptions beyond language evidence
* Private or inferred behavioral traits
* Subscriber communication guidance

## 3. Source Signals

This W‑VBP is derived exclusively from **publicly accessible digital assets**, which may include:

* Primary website copy
* Blog or long‑form written content
* Google Business Profile descriptions
* LinkedIn bio and public posts
* Public social media captions (if applicable)

Only **explicit language usage** is evaluated. No speculative inference is permitted.
