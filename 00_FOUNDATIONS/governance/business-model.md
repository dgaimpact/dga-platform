## DGA OPERATIONAL PILLAR MODEL (LOCKED)

DGA operates on **five non-negotiable operational pillars**.  
These pillars govern execution order, system boundaries, and responsibility separation.

They are **not marketing features**.

---

### **P1 — Prospecting**

**Purpose:**  
Attract, educate, and qualify potential DGA subscribers without promises, guarantees, or outcome claims.

Includes education-first positioning, pre-intake visibility checks, and PB prospect diagnostics.

**Mental anchor:** *Who should come in*

---

### **P2 — Intake & Onboarding**

**Purpose:**  
Establish a clean, normalized entity baseline for a new ACTIVE subscriber.

Includes entity data capture, NAP validation, platform verification, and readiness for audit and publishing systems.

**Mental anchor:** *Who they actually are*

---

### **P3 — Audit**

**Purpose:**  
Understand visibility, recommendability, and ecosystem context without bias or automation creep.

Includes:
- Snapshot audit protocols
- Silent internal monitoring
- Adhoc diagnostic audits (competitive, prospecting, ecosystem)

**Mental anchor:** *What’s happening*

---

### **P4 — Content Creation & Publishing**

**Purpose:**  
Create and distribute structured content that supports AI answer selection and entity corroboration.

Includes governed content creation, canonical publishing, and omni-channel reinforcement.

**Mental anchor:** *What we create and publish*

---

### **P5 — Relationship Continuity**

**Purpose:**  
Ensure no ACTIVE subscriber relationship ever goes cold, invisible, or purely transactional.

Includes human-led outreach, continuity tracking, and escalation without automation of intent or sensitivity.

**Mental anchor:** *How we show up as humans*

---

## 1. PURPOSE & AUTHORITY

This document defines the **business model, pricing logic, capacity discipline, and value-delivery structure** of DGA.

It exists to:
- prevent pricing and scope drift
- constrain interpretation
- protect long-term trust
- ensure execution follows intent
- support future acquisition diligence

If a downstream SOP, blueprint, or system conflicts with this document, the conflict is resolved **here first**.

---

## 2. WHAT DGA IS

DGA is a **market-limited, subscription-based AI visibility and relationship-leverage operating system** for MPs and REAs.

DGA is designed to:
- improve AI discoverability and recommendability
- reinforce clear professional entities
- protect referral positioning from commoditization
- operate with enforced scarcity by market

DGA is not a marketing service.  
It is **governed infrastructure**.

---

## 3. CORE SYSTEM COMPONENTS (ALWAYS-ON)

All subscriptions operate on the same governed system.

---

### 3.1 Visibility & Discoverability Audits

Audits govern all downstream action.

They define:
- entity clarity
- recommendation confidence
- contextual gaps
- reinforcement priorities

Content does not exist without audit direction.

---

### 3.2 Structured Content Engine (OCGF)

Content execution follows the **Omni-Channel Growth Framework (OCGF)** — a proprietary framework governing how authority signals are created, reinforced, and corroborated.

Content exists to strengthen **entities**, not generate traffic.

---

### 3.3 DGA Authority Hub  
*(Canonical Publishing Infrastructure)*

The **DGA Authority Hub** is the canonical home for long-form authority content.

It functions as:
- the AI-ingestible source of truth
- a stable reference layer independent of social platforms
- the long-term authority archive for each subscriber

---

### 3.4 DGA Trust Network  
*(Recommendation Confidence Layer)*

The **DGA Trust Network** provides public corroboration and professional validation.

It exists to:
- reinforce consistency
- support recommendation confidence
- validate entity legitimacy

It is not a lead marketplace.

---

### 3.5 Managed Omni-Channel Population System

Distribution is **done-for-you and governed**.

DGA controls population of required GEO/AIO platforms to ensure:
- consistency
- corroboration
- signal integrity

Execution is not left to subscribers or partners.  
Discretion at this layer would degrade confidence in DGA outcomes.

---

### 3.6 Voice Blueprint (VBP)

The **Voice Blueprint** ensures entity consistency across all outputs.

It governs:
- tone
- positioning
- confidence signals
- narrative continuity

Subscribers are not just visible — they are recognizable.

---

## 4. MARKET- AND NICHE-STRUCTURED CONTENT (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

DGA does not support generalist positioning.

AI systems reward **specificity within context**.

All content is structured by:
- market / territory
- professional role
- defined niche

Specificity is the mechanism that enables recommendability.

---

## 5. SCARCITY & MARKET CAPACITY DISCIPLINE

DGA enforces **limited availability by market**.

- All subscriptions consume capacity
- Payment source does not override limits
- Organizational size does not override limits
- When a market is full, it is closed

Scarcity is structural, not promotional.

---

## 6. MARKET CLASSIFICATION & CAPACITY LIMITS  
*(Per Market · Per Profession)*

| Market Type | Max Active Subscriptions |
|------------|--------------------------|
| Urban | 5 |
| Suburban | 4 |
| Rural | 3 |
| Cottage / Seasonal | 2 |

---

## 7. SUBSCRIPTION ARCHITECTURE

---

### 7.1 Solo (SO)

SO provides foundational infrastructure.

Includes audits, content creation, Authority Hub publishing, Trust Network presence, managed platform population, and Voice Blueprint alignment.

SO is **infrastructure**.

---

### 7.2 Playbook (PB) — MP Only

Playbook is a **relationship-leverage system**.

**Initial focus:** MP–REA referral relationships.

**Expectations:**
- referral partners are expected to refer
- PB partners onboard to DGA as sub-accounts
- relationships are active, visible, and reciprocal

PB is leverage — not marketing.

---

### 7.3 Enterprise (EN-MP / EN-REA)

Enterprise provides **organization-paid infrastructure at scale**.

- seat-based SO deployment
- consistency across agents
- recruiting and retention support

Enterprise is **not Playbook at scale**.

---

## 8. WEBSITE ACCESS & VISIBILITY GOVERNANCE

The DGA website is the **single source of truth** for content visibility, status, and accountability.

It is:
- read-only
- guidance-based
- not a CRM
- not execution
- not automation

---

### 8.1 Solo (SO) Website Access

SO subscribers access a dedicated **Content & Status Page** via DGA account number.

They can view:
- current audit snapshot
- active content and live URLs
- mandatory platform status
- monthly accordion archive
- cycle-specific to-do items

This increases clarity without increasing labor.

---

### 8.2 Playbook (PB) Website Access

PB subscribers access a **Playbook Master Page**.

Includes:
- PB content overview
- Realtor Referral Partner status dashboard
- individual REA content pages (read-only)

PBs distribute REA access directly, reinforcing ownership of the relationship and maintaining CASL compliance.

---

### Governing Rule

> **All DGA account types receive a website-based content and status page.**  
> **Playbook plans add partner oversight and referral enablement layers.**

---

## 9. PRICING & MONETIZATION

### Standard Monthly Pricing

- **SO:** $349  
- **PB:** $749  

**Enterprise:**
- 5–9 seats: $299 / seat
- 10–19 seats: $279 / seat

---

### Introductory Pricing (Deferred-Value Model)

- **SO:** $297 → $349  
- **PB:** $637 → $749  

Enterprise pricing is not discounted monthly.

---

## 10. RULES OF ENGAGEMENT (SUMMARY)

- ROE required for onboarding
- one-month cancellation notice
- pricing auto-transitions after intro period
- no negotiated capacity
- no retroactive adjustments

---

## 11. CLOSING STATEMENT

DGA is intentionally constrained so it remains valuable.

It is built for professionals who understand:
- visibility compounds
- recommendation confidence is fragile
- relationships require continuity
- systems outperform tactics

---
