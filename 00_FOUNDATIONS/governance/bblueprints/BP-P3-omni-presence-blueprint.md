# BP–P3–OMNI‑PRESENCE BLUEPRINT

## Canonical Design Domains, Audit Governance & System Boundaries

**Version:** v11.0 – Reworked to Align with Execution Doctrine Model
**Created:** 2025‑12‑13
**Status:** Governing Authority (Active)

**Related DGA Pillars (Reference Only):**
• P3 – Audit
• P4 – Content Creation & Publishing
• P5 – Post‑Publish Reinforcement

---

## FOUNDER DOCTRINE

This Blueprint documents **decisions already made**.

It exists to:

* prevent system drift
* constrain interpretation
* protect long‑term trust
* ensure execution follows intent

If a downstream system, ED, SOP, or automation conflicts with this Blueprint, the conflict must be resolved **here first**.

## 1. PURPOSE & AUTHORITY

This document is the **canonical governing Blueprint** for how DGA defines, evaluates, and constrains AI‑driven visibility and recommendability.

It governs:

* what visibility means
* what may be measured
* what audits are allowed to influence
* how the system may evolve

It does **not** define execution logic, schemas, tooling, or workflows.

---

## 2. ROLE OF THIS BLUEPRINT IN DGA

This Blueprint operates **above**:

* Execution Doctrines (ED)
* Schema & Asset Registry (REG)
* SOPs
* Replit / Supabase / Automation layers

Execution Doctrines translate this intent into deterministic behavior.

This Blueprint **constrains** those doctrines.

---

## 3. OMNI‑PRESENCE: WHAT IT IS (AND IS NOT)

Omni‑Presence exists to answer one question:

> *Is a given local professional structurally positioned to be selected or recommended by AI systems?*

Omni‑Presence is **not**:

* SEO
* traffic optimization
* performance marketing
* ranking manipulation

It is a **structural visibility system**, not a growth tactic.

---

## 4. DESIGN DOMAINS (CONCEPTUAL)

Design Domains describe **how visibility and trust are constructed**, not how systems are built.

### Domain 1 — Visibility Intelligence

Structured observation of entity credibility and AI behavior (GEO + AIO).

### Domain 2 — Content Activation Logic

Content exists **in response to audit findings**, never as a primary goal.

### Domain 3 — Entity Presence & Corroboration

Where an entity must exist for AI corroboration (sites, profiles, hubs).

### Domain 4 — Language, Trust & Interpretation

How DGA communicates without over‑claiming or implying certainty.

### Domain 5 — Governance & Evolution

How the system changes intentionally and defensibly.

---

## 5. AUDIT AS THE SYSTEM SOURCE OF TRUTH

The audit is the **only** authoritative source for:

* visibility state
* AI answer presence
* prioritization signals

Audits may inform:

* reporting
* content planning
* system direction

Audits may **not**:

* justify outcomes
* be retroactively altered
* be influenced by content performance

---

## 6. GEO & AIO — SEPARATION OF RESPONSIBILITY

**GEO (Generative Entity Optimization)** evaluates **structural inputs**:

* entity completeness
* corroboration signals
* presence consistency

**AIO (AI Answer, Selection & Recommendation)** observes **AI outputs**:

* whether entities appear
* how they are framed
* consistency across scenarios

They are:

* sequential
* complementary
* never interchangeable

---

## 7. AUDIT TYPES & CADENCE (GOVERNANCE)

This Blueprint governs **when** audits may occur, not how they execute.

Permitted audit classes:

* **Scheduled Audit** (baseline + 30‑day cadence)
* **Adhoc Audit** (diagnostic, non‑content‑triggering)

Execution specifics are defined in Execution Doctrines.

---

## 8. AUDIT → CONTENT RELATIONSHIP (ONE‑WAY)

Audit findings may:

* surface gaps
* identify opportunities
* inform content themes

Content may **never**:

* influence audit scoring
* alter audit logic
* justify or explain audit results

Audit → Content is strictly one‑directional.

---

## 9. SCORING PHILOSOPHY & TIME MECHANICS

* Internal scoring is **fractional and precise**
* External reporting is **rounded and calm**
* Day 00 establishes baseline only
* Subsequent audits emphasize **directional movement**

Scores are **signals**, not measurements or guarantees.

---

## 10. LANGUAGE & CONFIDENCE CONSTRAINTS

Allowed:

* pattern‑based interpretation
* directional language
* system‑level insights

Forbidden:

* guarantees
* predictions
* dominance claims
* account‑level causal attribution

These constraints apply across **all outputs**.

---

## 11. UNCERTAINTY AS A DESIGN FEATURE

AI systems are probabilistic.

Omni‑Presence:

* embraces uncertainty
* avoids false precision
* communicates cautiously

Certainty is never implied where it cannot be proven.

---

## 12. GOVERNED SYSTEM EVOLUTION

The system may evolve **only** when:

* AI platform behavior materially changes
* credible external research is released
* ecosystem norms shift

All changes require:

* review window
* documented rationale
* Blueprint update
* downstream ED updates

---

## 13. BETA & REVIEW WINDOWS

Beta exists to validate:

* system stability
* clarity
* cadence
* trust

During beta:

* audit logic is frozen
* language constraints are enforced
* learning flows through review, not execution

---

## 14. NON‑NEGOTIABLE INVARIANTS

1. Audits are authoritative
2. Audit → Content is one‑way
3. GEO ≠ AIO
4. Fractional internal scoring
5. Rounded external display
6. Human‑led audit review
7. No guarantees or predictions
8. Governance precedes optimization

Any violation requires formal Blueprint revision.
