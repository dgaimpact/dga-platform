## 1. Purpose

This document defines the **five non-negotiable operational pillars** of the Digital Growth Accelerator (DGA).

It exists to:
- establish clear ownership boundaries
- prevent execution drift
- enforce correct sequencing
- ensure every system, SOP, and automation knows **what it owns — and what it must not do**

This document is:
- canonical
- descriptive
- non-executing
- referenced by all downstream governance and execution artifacts

---

## 2. Context

DGA is governed as an **execution-disciplined operating system**, not a marketing service.

To maintain integrity, DGA separates responsibilities into five operational pillars.  
Each pillar defines:
- its purpose
- what it owns
- what it explicitly does **not** own
- the truth it establishes for downstream systems

Pillars are **not features**, **not pricing tiers**, and **not optional**.

---

## 3. Pillar Definitions

---

## P1 — Prospecting

### Purpose
P1 governs **who is allowed to enter the DGA ecosystem and under what conditions**.

It exists to:
- educate before selling
- qualify fit without promising outcomes
- protect downstream pillars from poor-fit accounts
- frame expectations clearly and conservatively

**Mental anchor:** *Who should come in*

---

### Owns
- Education-first positioning
- Pre-intake diagnostics and snapshots
- Prospect visibility checks
- Qualification and disqualification logic
- Entry gating into P2

---

### Does NOT Own
- Subscriber onboarding or activation
- Audits for active accounts
- Content creation or publishing
- Relationship follow-up
- CRM execution

P1 may **inform** P2, but may never activate accounts.

---

## P2 — Intake & Onboarding

### Purpose
P2 governs **how a qualified prospect becomes an ACTIVE DGA subscriber**.

It exists to:
- establish a clean, normalized entity baseline
- validate identity, platforms, and access
- remove ambiguity before audits or content begin
- protect audit and publishing systems from malformed inputs

**Mental anchor:** *Who they actually are*

---

### Owns
- Subscriber activation
- Account creation and normalization
- NAP and entity verification
- Platform access onboarding (e.g., GBP, GSC)
- Readiness confirmation for P3 and P4

---

### Does NOT Own
- Prospect qualification
- Ongoing audits
- Content creation or publishing
- Relationship cadence
- Performance enforcement

If P2 is incomplete, **nothing downstream may proceed**.

---

## P3 — Audit

### Purpose
P3 governs **observation, evaluation, and visibility-state determination**.

It exists to:
- establish objective visibility snapshots
- observe AI ecosystem behavior without bias
- detect change without reacting to it
- provide factual inputs to downstream systems

**Mental anchor:** *What’s happening*

---

### Owns
- Snapshot audits (Day 00, scheduled)
- GEO and AIO observation logic
- Visibility and recommendability scoring
- Audit lifecycle state management
- Confidence weighting and caps

---

### Does NOT Own
- Content creation decisions
- Publishing execution
- Prospect intake
- Relationship outreach
- Outcome promises or guarantees

Audit informs action — it never performs action.

---

## P4 — Content Creation & Publishing

### Purpose
P4 governs **the creation, formatting, and controlled distribution of authority content**.

It exists to:
- translate audit insight into structured artifacts
- reinforce entity corroboration
- populate required platforms consistently
- remove execution burden from subscribers

**Mental anchor:** *What we create and publish*

---

### Owns
- Long-form authority content creation
- Canonical publishing to the DGA Authority Hub
- Governed omni-channel population
- Content lifecycle tracking
- Voice Blueprint (VBP) application

---

### Does NOT Own
- Audit logic or interpretation
- Intake or onboarding
- Relationship follow-up
- Performance guarantees
- Subscriber-led publishing discretion

Content execution is system-led, not subscriber-driven.

---

## P5 — Relationship Continuity

### Purpose
P5 governs **how DGA shows up as a human system over time**.

It exists to:
- ensure no active relationship goes cold
- prevent DGA from becoming purely transactional
- protect trust, confidence, and retention
- enforce human presence at scale

**Mental anchor:** *How we show up as humans*

---

### Owns
- Human-led outreach cadence
- Relationship continuity tracking
- Escalation signaling
- Guardrails against over-automation

---

### Does NOT Own
- Prospect qualification
- Intake or audits
- Content creation or publishing
- Automated messaging
- Performance tracking

P5 protects trust — efficiency is secondary.

---

## 4. System Enforcement Rules

- Pillars operate **sequentially**, not in parallel
- No pillar may assume the authority of another
- Outputs may flow downstream only
- Violations invalidate execution, not outcomes

If a system or SOP crosses pillar boundaries, it is **out of compliance**.

---

## 5. Canonical Summary

> P1 decides **who should enter**.  
> P2 defines **who they are**.  
> P3 observes **what’s happening**.  
> P4 executes **what is published**.  
> P5 preserves **human continuity**.

This ordering is non-negotiable.
