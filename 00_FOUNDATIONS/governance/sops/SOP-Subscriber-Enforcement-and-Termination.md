## 1. Purpose

This SOP defines **when and how DGA may enforce boundaries**, up to and including **termination of a subscription**.

Its purpose is to:
- protect system integrity
- preserve trust across the DGA ecosystem
- prevent precedent erosion
- ensure termination decisions are deliberate, defensible, and documented

Termination is a **governance action**, not a relationship state.

---

## 2. What This SOP Governs

This SOP governs:

- Enforcement actions following escalation
- Conditions under which termination may be considered
- Required review and documentation steps
- Non-negotiable termination triggers

It applies only to **ACTIVE** accounts.

---

## 3. What This SOP Does *Not* Govern

This SOP does **not** govern:

- Normal relationship management (P5)
- Performance dissatisfaction
- Engagement level
- Temporary conflict or confusion
- Outcome frustration without governance violation

Poor results are not grounds for enforcement.

---

## 4. Entry Point: Escalation Required

Termination may only be considered if the relationship has entered the **Escalated** state under P5.

No termination action may occur without:
- documented escalation
- explicit reason for escalation
- human review

---

## 5. Non-Negotiable Enforcement Triggers

Termination **must be considered** if any of the following persist after correction is attempted.

### 5.1 Governance Rejection

- Repeated refusal to align with governing documents
- Pressure for undocumented exceptions
- Disregard for versioning or review discipline

---

### 5.2 Outcome-Based Demands

- Continued insistence on guarantees, rankings, or AI placement
- Framing DGA as a performance or marketing service
- Repeated boundary violations after correction

---

### 5.3 Reputational or Ethical Risk

- Misrepresentation of credentials or authority
- Regulatory, ethical, or legal risk affecting trust
- Behavior that undermines the Trust Network or Authority Hub

---

### 5.4 System Integrity Risk

- Attempts to bypass audit governance
- Manipulation of content or signals
- Actions that compromise corroboration integrity

---

## 6. Review & Decision Process

Before termination:

1. Escalation reason is documented
2. Subscriber is informed clearly and directly
3. Opportunity to correct is provided (where appropriate)
4. Governance review is conducted
5. Decision is recorded with rationale

Termination must never be impulsive.

---

## 7. Termination Outcomes

If termination is approved:

- Subscription is cancelled per contractual terms
- Access to systems is revoked
- Public artifacts are handled per Trust Network policy
- Relationship state is closed, not reclassified

Termination is final unless explicitly reapproved.

---

## 8. Enforcement Principles (Non-Negotiable)

- Enforcement protects the **system**, not ego
- Consistency matters more than convenience
- Silence is not consent
- Precedent is cumulative

---

## 9. Lock Statement

This SOP is authoritative once active.

Any enforcement or termination action taken outside this SOP is invalid.
