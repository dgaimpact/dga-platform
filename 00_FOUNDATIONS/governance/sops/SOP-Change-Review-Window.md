## 1. Purpose

This SOP defines **how and when changes** to governing DGA documents may be proposed, reviewed, approved, deferred, or rejected.

It exists to:
- prevent silent system drift
- protect decisions already made
- ensure execution follows intent
- preserve long-term trust and internal coherence

DGA evolves through **intentional review**, not incremental erosion.

---

## 2. What This SOP Governs

This SOP applies to **any change** involving:

- DGA Business Model documents
- Pillar definitions and boundaries
- Blueprints (BP)
- Execution Doctrines (ED)
- Canonical templates (BP, SOP, GUIDE, etc.)
- System-level rules affecting more than one pillar
- Any document that constrains downstream execution or automation

If a document defines **what must be true**, this SOP applies.

---

## 3. What This SOP Does *Not* Govern

This SOP does **not** apply to:

- Routine task execution
- Content outputs
- Client- or account-specific documents (e.g., VBP, IIP)
- Non-governing Guides that do not introduce rules or constraints

If a document does not constrain systems or behavior, it does not require a Change Review.

---

## 4. Change Initiation

A change may be proposed when:

- New evidence emerges
- An execution conflict is identified
- A governance gap is discovered
- Scale introduces unintended consequences
- Existing rules are shown to violate stated invariants

All proposed changes must be **explicit**.

Silent edits, implied interpretation shifts, and retroactive justification are prohibited.

---

## 5. Change Review Window

Changes may only be reviewed during a declared **Change Review Window**.

### Default Review Cadence
- Scheduled review window (e.g., monthly or quarterly), **or**
- An explicitly declared ad-hoc review window

Outside a declared window:
- Governing documents are considered **frozen**
- Execution must adapt to governance — not the reverse

There is no “soft” review state.

---

## 6. Review Criteria (Non-Negotiable)

Every proposed change must clearly answer:

1. What problem does this change solve?
2. Which document(s) does it modify?
3. Which pillar(s) are affected?
4. Does it violate any existing invariants?
5. What downstream systems or documents must be reviewed if approved?

If any answer is unclear, the change is **rejected or deferred**.

---

## 7. Approval, Rejection & Deferral

- **Approval** requires explicit acknowledgment
- **Rejection** requires documented rationale
- **Deferral** must specify:
  - what evidence or clarity is missing
  - when review may reoccur

No change is considered accepted without documentation.

---

## 8. Versioning & Record

All approved changes must:

- Increment document version
- Update the “Last Updated” date
- Include a brief change note describing intent and scope

Superseded logic must not persist silently.

---

## 9. Enforcement Rule

If execution, automation, or documentation conflicts with a governing document **outside a Change Review Window**, execution must be corrected.

Governance is not retroactively rewritten to justify execution.

---

## 10. Lock Statement

This SOP is authoritative and binding.

Any system, document, or execution behavior that bypasses or ignores the Change Review Window is invalid and must be corrected to align with this SOP.
