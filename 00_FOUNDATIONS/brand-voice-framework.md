# Brand Voice Framework  
*A Complete System for Capturing, Documenting, and Applying a Client’s Authentic Brand Voice Across Content, Messaging, and GEO Signals*

## 1. Purpose of the Brand Voice Framework
The Brand Voice Framework ensures every MP or REA client receives messaging and content that reflects their authentic style, tone, values, and personality.  
This eliminates generic content, reinforces brand identity, improves client trust, and strengthens the entity signals required for GEO (Generative Engine Optimization).

This framework directly addresses a common REA concern:
**“I don’t want content that dilutes the brand I’ve spent years building.”**

## 2. Outcomes of the Brand Voice Framework
Each client receives:

- **Brand Voice Blueprint (BVB)** — the master document defining voice, tone, language, personality, and messaging DNA  
- **Content Standards** for long-form, social, newsletters, and scripts  
- **Messaging DNA** detailing signature phrases, vocabulary, and themes  
- **Persona Alignment** with their audience niche  
- **Cross-Channel Consistency** through the OCGF system  

The BVB integrates with DGA’s OCGF, GEO strategy, and MP–REA engagement systems.

## 3. When the Brand Voice Framework Is Applied
The process is used:

1. During onboarding  
2. Before writing the foundation article  
3. Before creating derivative content  
4. Before producing scripts, emails, or REA-facing assets  
5. For audits, recommendations, and onboarding workflows  
6. Whenever niche, market, or positioning changes  

It is a required step for every new client.

## 4. Brand Voice Interview Workflow
The Brand Voice Interview uses the structured script in Notion.

### Interview Steps
1. **Context Setting** – explain purpose and value  
2. **Brand Personality Discovery** – tone, traits, perception  
3. **Audience & Niche Alignment** – who they serve and why  
4. **Messaging DNA** – signature phrasing, do/don’t language
