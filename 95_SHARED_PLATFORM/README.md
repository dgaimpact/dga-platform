📁 What will eventually go in 95_SHARED_PLATFORM/

Only assets that:

support multiple pillars

do not execute

do not govern

Example future contents:

95_SHARED_PLATFORM/
├── STACK/
├── PROMPT_LIBRARY/
├── SALES_MARKETING/
├── STYLE_GUIDES/


If you don’t have content for it yet, that’s fine.
An empty folder (with a README) is acceptable.
