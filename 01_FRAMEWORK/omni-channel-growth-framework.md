## **Overview**

The Omni-Channel Growth Framework (OCGF) is DGA’s proprietary content strategy that synchronizes Mortgage Professional and Real Estate Agent content to maximize GEO/AIO visibility.
It leverages long-form foundation content, structured derivative content, and coordinated publishing across multiple platforms.

**All OCGF content must align with the client’s Brand Voice Blueprint**, ensuring consistency across every channel and reinforcing their entity signals.

---

## **Core Components**

### **1. Foundation Articles**

* **3,000+ word pillar content** for both MP and REA partners
* **Niche-focused**, addressing specific market segments
* **Cross-linked** with partner articles for authority building
* **Schema-optimized** from day one
* **Credible sourcing** (CMHC, CREA, StatsCan, etc.)
* **Brand Voice calibration:** Every foundation article is written using the client’s Brand Voice Blueprint before derivation begins

---

### **2. Tiered Content Volumes**

Three subscription levels determine content frequency and channel coverage:

| Tier       | Foundation Articles | Supporting Content                             | Ideal For                                                 |
| ---------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **High**   | 4 articles/month    | Daily social, weekly emails, regular GBP posts | Established businesses with dedicated marketing resources |
| **Medium** | 2 articles/month    | 3× weekly social, bi-weekly emails, weekly GBP | Growing businesses with limited marketing time            |
| **Low**    | 1 article/month     | Weekly social, monthly emails, bi-weekly GBP   | New businesses or seasonal focus periods                  |

---

### **3. Synchronized Publishing**

* MP and REA articles published **simultaneously**
* **Cross-referenced hyperlinks** between partner articles
* **Coordinated social amplification** across channels
* **Unified messaging** aligned with **both niches and brand voice**

---

## **Foundational Requirements**

Every OCGF cycle begins with:

1. **Brand Voice Alignment**
   All long-form and derivative content must follow the client’s Brand Voice Blueprint.
   This ensures consistent tone, vocabulary, pacing, and personality across platforms.

2. **Niche & Market Calibration**
   Content must reflect the client’s precise niche, territory tier, and persona focus.

3. **GEO/AIO Alignment**
   Content must reinforce entity signals across all major search engines.
