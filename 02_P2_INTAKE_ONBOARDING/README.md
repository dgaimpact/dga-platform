## 1. Purpose of P2 — Intake & Onboarding

P2 — Intake & Onboarding governs **how a prospect becomes an ACTIVE DGA subscriber**.

This pillar exists to:
- establish a clean, normalized entity baseline
- validate identity, platforms, and readiness
- remove ambiguity before audits or content begin
- protect downstream pillars from incomplete or malformed data

Intake is **not marketing** and **not relationship management**.  
It is **entity normalization and activation discipline**.

---

## 2. What This Pillar Owns

P2 owns all systems, documents, and logic related to:

- Subscriber activation
- Account creation and normalization
- Entity data capture (NAP, platforms, identifiers)
- Platform and profile validation
- Readiness confirmation for P3 (Audit) and P4 (Content)

P2 defines **who the subscriber actually is** at the moment they become active.

---

## 3. What This Pillar Explicitly Does NOT Own

P2 does **not** own:

- Prospect qualification or diagnostics (P1)
- Ongoing audits or visibility measurement (P3)
- Content creation or publishing (P4)
- Relationship cadence or continuity (P5)
- Sales or pricing enforcement logic

Once intake is complete, **ownership transfers immediately** to downstream pillars.

### Subfolder Definitions

- **BLUEPRINTS/**  
  Define the strategic intent and design principles for intake and onboarding.

- **EXECUTION_DOCTRINES/**  
  Enforce deterministic behavior for activation, validation, and normalization.

- **SYSTEMS/**  
  Logical system designs supporting entity capture and readiness verification.

- **AUTOMATIONS/**  
  Workflow automations for intake routing, validation checks, and status changes.

- **OPS_SOPS/**  
  Human-executed intake procedures and exception handling.

- **ASSETS/**  
  Reference materials, intake checklists, and non-executing support content.

---

## 5. Governing Constraints

- P2 must not activate incomplete entities
- P2 must not infer missing data
- All required fields must be explicitly confirmed or rejected
- No audits may run before P2 completion
- No content may be created before P2 completion

If intake fails, the subscriber remains **inactive**.

---

## 6. Key Principle

> **P2 creates the truth that every other pillar depends on.  
> If P2 is wrong or rushed, everything downstream degrades.**

Precision and discipline matter more than speed.
