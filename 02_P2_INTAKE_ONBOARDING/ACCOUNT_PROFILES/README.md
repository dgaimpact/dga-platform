# Account Profiles Directory

This directory contains **account-specific Voice Blueprint Profiles (VBP)** and **Information Intake Profiles (IIP)**.

### Purpose
These documents are designed to:
- Capture the **professional voice** of the account holder (VBP)
- Capture **information delivery preferences** for communications *to* the account holder (IIP)

### Key Notes
- **Non-governing:** These profiles do not define rules, policies, or execution logic.
- **Replaceable:** They are updated or replaced as needed by new profiles or account-level changes.
- **Programmatically referenced:** They are used by DGA systems (like Replit AI-Agent, audit systems, and content generation) to ensure consistent tone, voice, and communication style.

### Location and Use
These profiles are stored and accessed within the **Account Profiles** directory for each individual account. The profiles are referenced in:
- Content creation (VBP)
- Audit and communication delivery (IIP)

They must **never** be merged, and their usage is strictly separated between VBP (for content) and IIP (for communications).
