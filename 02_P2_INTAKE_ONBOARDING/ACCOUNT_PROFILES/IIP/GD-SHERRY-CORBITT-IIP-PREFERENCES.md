## 1. Purpose

This document defines the **Information Intake Profile (IIP)** for **Sherry Corbitt**.

It exists to:
- Govern how information is delivered to Sherry by DGA
- Optimize clarity, structure, and usefulness of reports and recommendations
- Reduce friction in operational and audit communications

This document is:
- account-specific
- non-governing
- non-executing
- replaceable

---

## 2. Context

This IIP was collected through an **explicit follow-up intake**, separate from the VBP interview.

Accordingly:
- Preferences apply only to inbound communications
- No public voice or brand tone is included
- No inference from content style is permitted

---

## 3. Preferred Information Density

- High-detail by default  
- Full context preferred before conclusions  
- Comfortable with depth when structure is clear  
- Avoids oversimplification  

---

## 4. Structure of Explanations

- Logical sequencing
- Clear headings and sections
- Bullet points strongly preferred
- Summary or key takeaways clearly identified

---

## 5. Email & Report Tone Expectations

- Professional and friendly  
- Calm and straightforward  
- Informative rather than narrative  

Long narrative emails should be avoided in favor of:
- Clear takeaways
- Referenced or attached detailed materials

---

## 6. Recommendation Delivery Preferences

- Explicit guidance is expected  
- Clear articulation of the recommended next step  
- Helpful context on what “most people are doing”  
- No pressure or urgency framing unless operationally required

---

## 7. Follow-Up & Next-Step Clarity

- Gentle check-ins after a reasonable interval  
- No pushy follow-ups  
- Clear indication of:
  - what action is required
  - who owns the next step
  - expected timing (if applicable)

---

## 8. System Usage (Exclusive)

**Used ONLY for:**
- Audit report delivery
- Recommendation summaries
- Status updates
- Operational and system communications sent to Sherry Corbitt

**NEVER used for:**
- Blogs
- Articles
- Social content
- Authority or Omni-Presence materials

A separate Voice Blueprint Profile exists and governs all public-facing content.

---

## 9. Change Log

- v1.0 — Initial IIP created from intake follow-up  
- v1.1 — Structural separation from VBP into standalone IIP document
