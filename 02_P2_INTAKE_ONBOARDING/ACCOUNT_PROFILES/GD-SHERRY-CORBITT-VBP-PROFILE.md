## 1. Purpose

This document defines the **Voice Blueprint Profile (VBP)** for **Sherry Corbitt**.

It exists to:
- Provide an authoritative reference for Sherry’s outward professional voice

This VBP was created from a **custom interview** with Sherry Corbitt.

Accordingly:
- This interview-based VBP is authoritative

- No delivery or communication preferences are included by design

---

Sherry’s professional voice is:
- professional
- informed
- caring
- empathetic
- direct without being cold

Her communication style emphasizes reassurance, clarity, and confidence—particularly in high-stress or emotionally charged financial situations.

## 7. AI Guardrails for Content Creation

When generating Omni-Presence content using this VBP, AI systems must:
- Preserve a calm, reassuring, education-forward tone
- Avoid urgency, hype, or outcome promises
- Maintain professional warmth without casual informality
- Anchor outward identity consistently to the primary GBP entity
- Reflect choice, time, and clarity as core themes

AI systems must not infer:
- Delivery preferences
- Communication formatting expectations
- Personal workflow or operational habits

---

## 8. System Usage (Exclusive)

**Used ONLY for:**
- Blogs
- Articles
- Authority Hub content
- Public-facing Omni-Presence materials

**NEVER used for:**
- Audit delivery
- Recommendations
- Operational or system emails
- DGA → account holder communications

A separate Information Intake Profile exists and governs those use cases.
