## 1. Purpose

This document represents the **authoritative Voice Blueprint Profile (VBP)** and **Information Intake Profile (IIP)** for **Sherry Corbitt**.

It exists to:
- Provide a single, account-level source of truth for Sherry’s professional voice
- Provide explicit instructions for how DGA systems must communicate *with* Sherry
- Be referenced programmatically by Replit without inference or reinterpretation

This document is:
- account-specific
- non-governing
- non-executing
- replaceable

Governance and execution rules are defined elsewhere (BP / ED). This document binds those rules **locally** to this account.

---

## 2. Context

This profile was created from:
- A completed **VBP interview** with Sherry Corbitt
- A completed **IIP follow-up selection**

This is an **interview-based profile**, not scan-derived.

Accordingly:
- No W-VBP is in effect
- No provisional IIP is in effect

This document supersedes any previously inferred voice or delivery assumptions for this account.
