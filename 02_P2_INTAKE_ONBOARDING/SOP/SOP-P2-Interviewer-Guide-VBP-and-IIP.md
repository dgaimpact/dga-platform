## 1. Purpose

This SOP defines the **standard, repeatable process** for conducting a Voice Blueprint Profile (VBP) and Information Intake Profile (IIP) interview.

It applies to:

* PB subscribers interviewing their REA referral partners (sub-accounts)
* DGA staff onboarding SO and PB subscribers

The goal is to capture:

* how the interviewee communicates publicly (VBP), and
* how the interviewee prefers to receive information privately (IIP)

This SOP prioritizes **ease of execution**, **voice authenticity**, and **system consistency**.

---

## 2. Scope & Boundaries

### In Scope

* Interview preparation and framing
* Audio recording standards
* Interview question delivery
* Transcript creation and upload
* Post-interview handoff to Replit

### Out of Scope

* Editing or approving generated profiles
* Sharing profiles with interviewees
* Manual content or email creation
* Revising profiles without a new interview

---

## 3. Interview Framing & Transparency

At the beginning of the interview, the interviewer should explain the purpose using natural language similar to:

> “This conversation helps us understand how you naturally communicate so any content created on your behalf actually sounds like you. We’ll also touch on how you prefer to receive information from us. This isn’t a test — just a conversation.”

AI may be mentioned at a high level:

> “We use AI to help scale content and communication, but it only works well when we capture your real voice first.”

Do not explain downstream systems, audits, or automation logic.

---

## 4. Recording Requirements (Non-Negotiable)

* **Audio recording is mandatory** for all interviews
* Video is optional and secondary
* If bandwidth or stability issues occur:

  * disable video
  * prioritize clean audio

If audio quality is compromised, pause and correct before continuing.

---

## 5. Interview Length & Pacing

* Target duration: **30–45 minutes**
* Some conversational drift is acceptable
* Do not rush responses
* Do not skip questions to save time

The interview is considered valid as long as:

* all core sections are asked, and
* transcript quality is usable

---

## 6. Interview Questions (Read Verbatim)

Questions must be read as written. Natural paraphrasing is acceptable. Interviewees must **never** receive questions in advance.

## 7. Creating the Transcript (Required)

The transcript is the **required artifact** for this process.

Requirements:

* File format: **.txt** (plain text)
* One continuous transcript file
* No rewriting, summarizing, or interpretation
* Minor readability cleanup is acceptable

---

## 8. Recommended Free Transcription Tools

Interviewers may use any transcription tool they prefer. The following free tools are recommended:

* **Tactiq** — browser-based, quick export to text
* **Otter.ai (free tier)** — reliable for conversational interviews
* **Zoom / Google Meet transcripts** — acceptable if audio quality is strong

These tools are intended for **short-term use only**.

---

## 9. Uploading to the Replit Interface

1. Navigate to the **DGA Interview Upload** URL (Replit-hosted)
2. Enter:

   * your account number
   * interviewee first and last name
3. Upload the **.txt transcript file**
4. Submit

Replit will:

* validate transcript completeness against the interview script
* generate:

  * a VBP or W-VBP file
  * an IIP or W-IIP file
* store current files in ACCOUNT_PROFILES/ACTIVE
* archive any replaced profiles automatically
* notify DGA staff upon completion

No further action is required from the interviewer.

---

## 10. What Not to Do (Strict)

* Do not edit transcripts
* Do not rewrite or summarize responses
* Do not share generated profiles
* Do not request revisions from interviewees

If output later feels misaligned, the correct action is **a new interview**, not edits.

---

## 11. Completion Criteria

This SOP is considered successfully executed when:

* all interview sections were asked
* audio quality was sufficient for transcription
* a transcript was uploaded to Replit
* Replit confirmed profile generation
