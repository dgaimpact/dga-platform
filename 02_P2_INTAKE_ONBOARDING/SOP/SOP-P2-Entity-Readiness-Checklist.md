## 1. Purpose

This SOP defines the **canonical Entity Readiness Checklist** required before any entity may be considered **ACTIVE** within DGA.

Its purpose is to:
- ensure entity clarity before audit
- prevent premature execution
- protect downstream interpretation and content
- establish a single, defensible activation signal

No audit, content, or publishing may occur until this checklist is satisfied.

---

## 2. What This SOP Governs

This SOP governs:

- Minimum readiness requirements for entity activation
- The checklist used to determine readiness
- How readiness is validated and recorded
- Enforcement rules when readiness is incomplete

This checklist is the **only authoritative activation gate**.

---

## 3. What This SOP Does *Not* Govern

This SOP does **not** govern:

- Sales qualification
- Prospect education
- Pricing or payment
- Audit scoring
- Content strategy

This SOP governs **readiness**, not success.

## 4. Entity Readiness Checklist (All Required)

An entity is considered **READY** only when **all** of the following sections are satisfied.

---

### 4.1 Entity Identity

- Legal or professional operating name confirmed
- Entity type defined (individual, team, brokerage, enterprise)
- Primary professional role identified (MP, REA, etc.)
- Licensing or credential status declared (where applicable)

**Failure Mode Prevented:** Misattribution, authority confusion

---

### 4.2 Market & Scope Definition

- Primary market / territory defined
- Scope boundaries acknowledged (where DGA applies / does not apply)
- Any exclusivity or capacity constraints disclosed and accepted

**Failure Mode Prevented:** Market overlap, expectation creep

---

### 4.3 Digital Presence Anchors

- Primary website or authority surface identified
- Google Business Profile (or equivalent) identified where applicable
- Primary professional profiles disclosed (e.g., LinkedIn)

Absence must be **explicit**, not assumed.

**Failure Mode Prevented:** False negatives in audit

---

### 4.4 Content & Authority Baseline

- Existing content sources disclosed (if any)
- Prior SEO or marketing activity acknowledged at a high level
- No assumptions about authority or performance carried forward

Audit begins from **neutral observation**.

---

### 4.5 Governance Acknowledgment

Entity explicitly acknowledges and accepts:
- Governance-first model
- No outcome guarantees
- Audit neutrality
- Human-in-the-loop constraints
- Enforcement and termination authority

This acknowledgment must be explicit.

**Failure Mode Prevented:** Downstream dispute

---

### 4.6 Readiness Declaration

- Intent to proceed with onboarding confirmed
- Checklist reviewed and affirmed
- Any provisional items clearly labeled and approved

Readiness must be **declared**, not inferred.

---

## 5. Validation & Recording

- Checklist completion must be recorded
- Any provisional items must be documented
- Activation date must be explicit

If readiness cannot be validated, the entity remains **INACTIVE**.

---

## 6. Enforcement Rule

If any checklist item is incomplete:

- Entity must not be marked ACTIVE
- Audit must not begin
- Content or publishing must not proceed

Execution convenience does not override readiness.

---

## 7. Relationship to Other Pillars

- P1 defines **who may proceed**
- P2 defines **who may activate**
- P3 observes **what exists**
- P4 acts **only after observation**
- P5 maintains continuity **after activation**

This checklist is the **hinge point** between intent and execution.

---

## 8. Lock Statement

This SOP is authoritative.

Any audit, content creation, publishing, or relationship continuity initiated without satisfying the Entity Readiness Checklist is invalid and must be corrected.
