## 1. Purpose of This Guide

This guide is here to help you confidently run a **natural, low-pressure interview** that captures how someone really communicates.

You don’t need to prepare. You don’t need to explain systems. You don’t need to manage what happens afterward.

Your role is simple:

* ask the questions
* listen
* record
* upload the transcript

Everything else is handled for you.

---

## 2. When to Use This Guide

Use this guide when you are:

* interviewing an REA referral partner as part of a PB relationship
* conducting an onboarding interview for a new subscriber

Do **not** use this guide to:

* evaluate performance
* sell services
* explain DGA systems in detail
* review or edit the final profiles

---

## 3. What This Is (and Is Not)

### What This Guide *Is*

* A conversation aid
* A confidence builder
* A reminder of what matters most

### What This Guide *Is Not*

* A script to rehearse
* A test for the interviewee
* A branding or marketing exercise

The best interviews sound like conversations, not questionnaires.

---

## 4. Before the Call

### What You Need

* A quiet space
* A stable internet connection
* Audio recording enabled
* This guide open

### Important Reminders

* Do **not** send the questions in advance
* Do **not** ask the interviewee to prepare
* Do **not** explain how the answers will be used in detail

---

## 5. How to Open the Conversation

Open naturally. A simple framing works best:

> “This conversation helps us understand how you naturally communicate so any content created on your behalf actually sounds like you. We’ll also touch on how you like to receive information. It’s just a conversation — there are no right or wrong answers.”

If AI comes up, keep it high level:

> “We use AI to help scale things, but it only works when we capture your real voice first.”

Then start the questions.

---

## 6. During the Interview

### Best Practices

* Ask the questions in order
* Let the interviewee finish their thoughts
* Allow pauses
* Follow their energy

### Recording Rules

* Audio recording is required
* Video is optional
* If the connection is unstable, turn video off

### If an Answer Feels Short

That’s okay. Do not push or rephrase aggressively. Move on.

A few lighter answers will not compromise the result.

---

## 7. The Interview Questions

Use the full interview script provided to you. Read the questions clearly and let the conversation flow.

You do not need to explain *why* a question is being asked.

---

## 8. After the Call

Once the interview ends:

* stop the recording
* thank the interviewee
* do **not** summarize the conversation
* do **not** ask for clarification afterward

The interview is complete at this point.

---

## 9. Creating the Transcript

Create a transcript from the recording.

**Requirements:**

* File format: `.txt`
* One continuous transcript
* No rewriting or summarizing

### Recommended Free Tools

* **Tactiq**
* **Otter.ai (free tier)**
* **Zoom / Google Meet transcripts**

These tools are only needed temporarily.

---

## 10. Uploading the Transcript

1. Go to the **DGA Interview Upload** page
2. Enter:

   * your account number
   * interviewee first and last name
3. Upload the `.txt` transcript file
4. Submit

That’s it.

No review. No follow-up. No edits.

---

## 11. What *Not* to Do

To protect authenticity and momentum, please avoid the following:

* Don’t edit the transcript
* Don’t rewrite answers
* Don’t share the profiles with the interviewee
* Don’t request changes or approvals
* Don’t explain how content will be generated

If something feels off later, the solution is a **new interview**, not revisions.

---

## 12. What Happens Next (For Your Awareness)

After upload:

* the system generates a Voice Blueprint (VBP)
* the system generates an Information Intake Profile (IIP)
* files are stored and versioned automatically

You don’t need to do anything further.

---

## 13. Final Reminder

You are not responsible for perfection.

Your job is simply to:

* show up
* listen
* follow the guide

The system does the rest.
