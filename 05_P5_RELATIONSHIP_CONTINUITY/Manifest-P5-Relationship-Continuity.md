Version: v1.0  
Created: 2025-12-29  
Status: Canonical Index (Active)

Primary Pillar:
- P5 — Relationship Continuity

## 1. Purpose

This manifest provides a **single authoritative index** of everything that defines, governs, constrains, or supports P5.

It exists to:
- eliminate ambiguity about what is “in scope” for P5
- prevent shadow documents or parallel definitions
- support audits, reviews, and diligence
- act as the entry point for all future P5 work

If a document is not listed here, it is **not authoritative for P5**.

---

## 2. Canonical Blueprint (Authoritative)

- **BP–P5–Relationship-Continuity.md**  
  Foundational intent, philosophy, invariants, and non-negotiables.

---

## 3. Execution Doctrines (Binding)

- **ED–P5–Relationship-Continuity–Scope-&-Non-Scope**
- **ED–P5–Relationship-Continuity–Core-Definitions**
- **ED–P5–Relationship-Continuity–Cadence-Rules**
- **ED–P5–Relationship-Continuity–Signals-&-Escalation**
- **ED–P5–Relationship-Continuity–State-&-Data-Rules**
- **ED–P5–Relationship-Continuity–Human-vs-System-Responsibilities**
- **ED–P5–Relationship-Continuity–Automation-Constraints**
- **ED–P5–Relationship-Continuity–Downstream-Enforcement-&-Consumption**
- **ED–P5–Relationship-Continuity–Compliance-&-Auditability**
- **ED–P5–Relationship-Continuity–Final-Lock-Statement**

These documents collectively **lock** P5.

---

## 4. Registry (Canonical Data Surface)

- **REG–P5–Relationship-Continuity**  
  Exclusive definition of fields, enums, and constraints.

---

## 5. SOPs (Binding, Procedural)

- **SOP–P5–Record-Human-Touchpoint**
- **SOP–P5–Interpret-Continuity-Visibility**

All SOPs must conform to OPS_SOPS–P5–README.

---

## 6. Guides (Informational)

- **GUIDE–P5–Understanding-Relationship-Continuity**

Guides explain concepts without directing behavior.

---

## 7. Systems & Automation Specs (Non-Executing)

- **SYSTEMS–P5–Continuity-Visibility-Surface-Spec**
- **AUTOMATIONS–P5–Continuity-Reminder-Behavior-Spec**

These define limits and constraints, not implementations.

---

## 8. Tools & Inspection

- **TOOLS–P5–Continuity-Compliance-Checklist**

Used for verification and audit only.

---

## 9. Folder READMEs (Structural Governance)

- **P5 — Relationship Continuity README**
- **OPS_SOPS–P5–README**
- **CONTENT_LIBRARY–P5–README**
- **ASSETS–P5–README**

These govern how materials within each folder may exist and be used.

---

## 10. Supersession & Conflict Rules

In case of conflict:

1. Pillar Lock Reference prevails  
2. Blueprint prevails over all others  
3. Execution Doctrines prevail over SOPs and Specs  
4. Registry prevails over Systems & Automations  
5. SOPs prevail over Guides  

Unlisted artifacts have no authority.

---

## 11. Change Control

Any addition, removal, or modification requires:

- update to this manifest
- version increment
- confirmation against the P5 lock
- documented rationale

Manifest drift is treated as governance failure.

---

## 12. Final Statement

> **This manifest is the map.  
> Anything off the map is out of bounds.**
