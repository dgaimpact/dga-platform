## 1. Purpose of This Guide

This guide exists to explain **what Relationship Continuity means inside DGA** — without governance language, systems thinking, or operational pressure.

It helps you:
- understand what P5 tracks (and what it does not)
- interpret continuity visibility correctly
- avoid accidentally turning relationships into metrics or tasks

This guide is **informational**, not procedural.

---

## 2. When to Use This Guide

Use this guide when:

- you are new to DGA or P5
- you see continuity states and want to understand them
- you feel unsure what a “lapse” means
- you want to explain P5 to someone else accurately

Do **not** use this guide:
- to decide when to reach out
- to justify action or inaction
- as a performance reference

---

## 3. What Relationship Continuity *Is*

Relationship Continuity answers one simple question:

> **Has a human from DGA shown up recently?**

That’s it.

It does **not** answer:
- whether the relationship is strong
- whether the subscriber is happy
- whether outcomes are improving
- whether someone should act

Continuity is about **presence over time**, not quality or results.

---

## 4. What Relationship Continuity *Is Not*

Relationship Continuity is **not**:

- a relationship health score
- a risk signal
- a performance indicator
- a prioritization tool
- a reminder that you “should” do something

If you feel pressure from a continuity signal, something has been misinterpreted.

---

## 5. How Time Is Used

P5 uses **time only**.

- A recorded human touchpoint resets the clock
- No touchpoint means time continues to pass
- Visibility increases as time passes

There is no:
- judgment
- acceleration
- penalty
- reward

Time simply becomes visible.

---

## 6. Understanding the Continuity States

### Current  
A human touchpoint occurred within the standard window.

### Approaching Lapse  
More than 60 days have passed since the last touchpoint.

### Lapsed  
More than 90 days have passed since the last touchpoint.

These labels describe **elapsed time only**.  
They do not describe relationships.

---

## 7. Why Lapse Visibility Exists

Lapse visibility exists because:

- absence is real
- invisibility creates false confidence
- automation hides reality
- honesty builds trust

A visible lapse is not a failure.  
It is simply honest.

---

## 8. What to Do When You See a Lapse

There is no required action.

You may:
- acknowledge it
- think about it
- decide to act later
- decide not to act at all

All responses are valid.

P5 is intentionally non-prescriptive.

---

## 9. Why Automation Is Forbidden Here

Automation is powerful — and dangerous — at the relationship layer.

Once systems:
- decide when to reach out
- generate personal messages
- optimize timing

Trust becomes simulated.

P5 refuses that trade-off.

---

## 10. Final Perspective

P5 exists to protect something fragile:

> **Human trust cannot be optimized without damaging it.**

So DGA chooses restraint.

---

## Final Note

If P5 feels “boring,” it is working as intended.
