# PB-REA Relationship Continuity Framework (RCF)
## Quick Reference

### What This Is
A simple, repeatable structure for maintaining strong partner relationships
without awkward check-ins or transactional pressure.

RCF governs **presence over time**, not selling.

---

### The Continuity Loop (Fixed Order)

1. **Relationship Active**
2. **Progress Snapshot**  
   Shared context is established.
3. **Alignment Conversation**  
   Meaning and direction are confirmed.
4. **Group / Peer Discussion**  
   Shared patterns surface.
5. **Quiet Validation Touchpoint**  
   Presence is reinforced.

After Step 5, the cycle repeats.

### Core Rules

- The loop has **no terminal state** while the relationship is active
- Components execute in a **fixed order**
- No component operates independently
- Silence between components is a **relationship risk**
- Structure replaces ad-hoc outreach

---

### What This Is Not

- Not a sales cadence
- Not a referral ask framework
- Not a marketing campaign
- Not a networking group

RCF is a **relationship operating system**.

---

### When RCF Is Working

- Conversations feel expected, not forced
- Partners remain responsive over time
- Referrals occur naturally
- You are remembered as organized and thoughtful

---

### Reminder

RCF defines **structure**, not scripts.
Execution details live in the PB-REA RCF SOP.
