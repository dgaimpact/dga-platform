How PB-REA subscribers execute the Relationship Continuity Framework (RCF)

Version: v1.0  
Created: 2025-01-30  
Document Type: SOP

Derived From:
- GD–PB-REA–Relationship-Continuity-Framework–RCF

---

## 1. Purpose

This SOP defines **how PB-REA subscribers execute** the Relationship Continuity
Framework (RCF) in real-world partner and referral ecosystems.

It translates framework structure into **repeatable human behavior** while
preserving professionalism, consistency, and relationship integrity.

---

## 2. When This SOP Applies

This SOP applies when:
- a PB-REA subscriber maintains ongoing professional relationships
- partners are referral-based or influence-based
- continuity is desired independent of active transactions

This SOP does not require:
- transactions
- campaigns
- sales outreach
- referral asks

---

## 3. Operating Principle

> The goal of execution is **presence without pressure**.

RCF execution prioritizes:
- consistency over intensity
- relevance over frequency
- clarity over persuasion

---

## 4. Monthly Execution Rhythm

PB-REA subscribers execute RCF on a **monthly cadence** using four steps.
The cadence should remain consistent.

### Step 1 — Partner Progress Snapshot

**Objective:**  
Establish shared context.

**Execution:**
- Prepare a brief update relevant to the partner relationship
- Focus on market movement, shared clients, visibility changes, or directional insight
- Keep the snapshot concise and neutral

**Guidelines:**
- No selling
- No calls to action
- No performance claims

---

### Step 2 — 1:1 Alignment Conversation

**Objective:**  
Maintain relevance and alignment.

**Execution:**
- Schedule a short conversation (15–20 minutes)
- Confirm shared priorities or observations
- Surface any changes in focus or opportunity

**Guidelines:**
- Use a consistent agenda
- Avoid transactional framing
- End with clarity, not requests

---

### Step 3 — Curated Group Discussion

**Objective:**  
Surface patterns and normalize shared challenges.

**Execution:**
- Invite a small, intentional group of partners (3–6)
- Select a single discussion topic
- Facilitate lightly; allow peers to contribute

**Guidelines:**
- No presentations
- No pitching
- No dominance by any participant

---

### Step 4 — Quiet Validation Touchpoint

**Objective:**  
Reinforce presence without agenda.

**Execution:**
- Send a brief personal note, insight, or acknowledgment
- Reference prior context where appropriate

**Guidelines:**
- Keep it short
- No follow-up required
- No expectation of response

---

## 5. Timing Guidance

- Execute the four steps over approximately 30 days
- Maintain the same sequence each month
- If a step must be delayed, acknowledge it explicitly

Silence should never replace a step.

---

## 6. Common Execution Errors (Avoid)

PB-REA subscribers should avoid:
- skipping steps without acknowledgment
- turning snapshots into sales updates
- using group discussions for promotion
- asking for referrals during continuity moments
- over-communicating to “force” engagement

---

## 7. Success Indicators (Qualitative)

RCF execution is working when:
- conversations feel natural and expected
- partners remain responsive over time
- referrals occur organically
- the subscriber is remembered as organized and thoughtful

These indicators are experiential, not numeric.

---

## 8. Relationship Hygiene Rules

- Respect time boundaries
- Keep interactions professional
- Avoid urgency unless required
- Default to clarity over charisma

---

## 9. Escalation & Adjustment

If a relationship becomes dormant:
- do not increase pressure
- re-establish context using Step 1
- reassess partner relevance if silence persists

RCF supports continuity, not forced participation.

---

## 10. Revision Control

Changes to this SOP require:
- consistency with the governing GD
- clarity on execution impact
- version increment and rationale
