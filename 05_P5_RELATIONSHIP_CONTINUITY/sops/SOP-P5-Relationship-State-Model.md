## 1. Purpose

This SOP defines a **presence-only relationship state model** for **P5 — Relationship Continuity**.

Its purpose is to:
- maintain human visibility and continuity
- prevent silent relationship decay
- trigger appropriate human attention
- avoid transactional or automated treatment of relationships

This model observes **presence**, not performance.

---

## 2. What This SOP Governs

This SOP governs:

- How relationships are classified over time
- The meaning of each relationship state
- When human attention is required
- What transitions are permitted

It does **not** score, rank, or evaluate relationship quality.

---

## 3. What This SOP Does *Not* Govern

This SOP does **not** govern:

- Relationship success or outcomes
- Frequency of communication
- Content cadence
- Automation rules or triggers
- CRM engagement metrics

This model exists to support **human judgment**, not replace it.

---

## 4. Relationship States (Presence-Only)

Every ACTIVE relationship must exist in **one and only one** of the following states.

### 4.1 Active

**Definition:**  
Recent, visible human interaction exists.

**Indicators (non-exhaustive):**
- Direct conversation
- Meaningful check-in
- Collaborative activity
- Confirmed mutual awareness

**Expectation:**  
No immediate action required.

---

### 4.2 Quiet

**Definition:**  
No recent interaction, but no risk indicators present.

**Indicators:**
- Time-based absence only
- No signals of dissatisfaction or disengagement

**Expectation:**  
Monitor. Light human check-in may be appropriate.

---

### 4.3 Dormant

**Definition:**  
Extended absence of meaningful interaction.

**Indicators:**
- Prolonged silence
- Missed or unacknowledged outreach
- Relationship drifting toward invisibility

**Expectation:**  
Human re-engagement required.

---

### 4.4 Escalated

**Definition:**  
Explicit attention is required to protect trust or continuity.

**Indicators:**
- Expressed concern or dissatisfaction
- Repeated disengagement
- Structural risk to the relationship
- External signals requiring response

**Expectation:**  
Deliberate human intervention required.

---

## 5. State Transitions

- States may move **forward or backward** based on observation
- Transitions must reflect **reality**, not intent
- Automated promotion or suppression of states is prohibited

Human judgment governs all transitions.

---

## 6. Enforcement Rule

- Every ACTIVE relationship must always have a state
- States must not be inferred from system metrics alone
- Absence of state assignment is a system failure

If a relationship cannot be clearly classified, it defaults to **Dormant** until resolved.

---

## 7. Lock Statement

This SOP is authoritative.

Any system, automation, or execution behavior that attempts to score, optimize, or automate relationship states violates P5 governance and must be corrected.
