## 1. Purpose

This SOP defines **what constitutes a legitimate human touchpoint** within **P5 — Relationship Continuity**.

Its purpose is to:
- preserve genuine human trust
- prevent automation creep
- avoid transactional relationship behavior
- ensure presence is real, not simulated

A touchpoint is meaningful **only if it reflects human intent**.

---

## 2. What This SOP Governs

This SOP governs:

- What qualifies as a human touchpoint
- What explicitly does **not** qualify
- How touchpoints relate to relationship states
- Guardrails against artificial or automated “presence”

This SOP does **not** mandate frequency or cadence.

---

## 3. What This SOP Does *Not* Govern

This SOP does **not** govern:

- Sales follow-ups
- Marketing outreach
- Automated notifications
- Content distribution
- CRM activity metrics

This SOP governs **human presence**, not activity volume.

---

## 4. Qualifying Human Touchpoints

A human touchpoint must meet **all** of the following criteria.

### 4.1 Intentional

- Initiated with conscious human intent
- Not triggered solely by time, automation, or system rules
- Reflects awareness of the specific relationship

---

### 4.2 Contextual

- Acknowledges the individual or organization
- References relevant context, history, or state
- Is not generic or templated beyond recognition

---

### 4.3 Reciprocal-Capable

- Allows for response, dialogue, or engagement
- Is not a broadcast or one-way notification
- Creates space for human reply

---

### 4.4 Trust-Preserving

- Respects boundaries and professional tone
- Does not pressure, manipulate, or extract
- Reinforces continuity, not obligation

---

## 5. Examples of Valid Human Touchpoints

The following **may** qualify when performed intentionally:

- Personal email written specifically for the recipient
- Direct phone or video conversation
- Handwritten or personal note
- Context-aware check-in referencing current state
- Collaborative discussion related to shared work

Qualification depends on **how**, not just **what**.

---

## 6. Explicitly Non-Qualifying Actions

The following **do not** qualify as human touchpoints:

- Automated emails or sequences
- System notifications or reminders
- Bulk messages or broadcasts
- Social media likes, comments, or reactions
- Content publishing or tagging
- “Just checking in” messages without context

These actions may support systems — they do not maintain relationships.

---

## 7. Relationship State Implications

- **Active:** Touchpoints may occur but are not required
- **Quiet:** A light, intentional human touch may be appropriate
- **Dormant:** A deliberate re-engagement touch is expected
- **Escalated:** Direct human attention is required

Touchpoints should reflect the **current state**, not attempt to mask it.

---

## 8. Enforcement Rule

- Human touchpoints must not be simulated by automation
- No system may mark a relationship “active” based solely on non-qualifying actions
- Artificial presence violates P5 governance

If intent cannot be clearly identified, the action does not qualify.

---

## 9. Lock Statement

This SOP is authoritative.

Any system, process, or behavior that treats automated or generic activity as a human touchpoint violates P5 governance and must be corrected.
