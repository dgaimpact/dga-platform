Created: 2025-12-16  
Last Updated: 2025-12-29  
Status: Active

Applies To:
- DGA Core Platform operators
- Any human acting under DGA authority who records P5 continuity data

Primary Pillar:
- P5 — Relationship Continuity

Governing Authority:
- BP–P5–Relationship-Continuity.md
- REG–P5–Relationship-Continuity.md
- All ED–P5–Relationship-Continuity Execution Doctrines

## 1. Purpose

This SOP defines the **only permitted procedure** for recording a Human Touchpoint in P5.

It exists to:
- ensure continuity data reflects real human presence
- prevent inferred, automated, or qualitative recording
- preserve cadence integrity and auditability
- keep meaning, sentiment, and performance outside P5

This SOP governs **recording behavior only**.

---

## 2. When This SOP Applies

Use this SOP **only when**:

- a real human-to-human interaction has occurred
- a human acting under DGA authority participated directly
- the date of the interaction is known with certainty

Do **not** use this SOP:
- to log automated messages
- to log content publishing or audit delivery
- to compensate for missed continuity
- to improve appearance of presence

Absence must remain visible.

---

## 3. What This SOP Is (and Is Not)

### What This SOP *Is*

- A mechanical rule for recording a date
- A safeguard against automation creep
- A control that protects P5 neutrality

### What This SOP *Is Not*

- A definition of relationship quality
- A guide for outreach strategy
- A place to store context or notes
- A performance or engagement signal

---

## 4. Preconditions (All Must Be True)

Before recording a touchpoint, confirm:

- the interaction involved direct human participation
- the interaction was intentional (not system-triggered)
- the interaction occurred on a known calendar date
- you personally participated in or directly confirmed it

If any condition is false, **do not record a touchpoint**.

---

## 5. Procedure — Recording the Touchpoint

1. Identify the correct `relationship_id`  
2. Confirm the interaction meets the P5 Human Touchpoint definition  
3. Enter the **actual calendar date** the interaction occurred (YYYY-MM-DD)  
4. Save the record  

No additional fields may be created or populated.

---

## 6. Validation Rules

When recording a touchpoint:

- future dates are invalid
- backdating is permitted only if accurate
- estimated or inferred dates are prohibited
- system defaults must not overwrite human input

If the date is uncertain, the touchpoint must not be recorded.

---

## 7. What Happens After Recording

Upon save:

- `last_touchpoint_date` is updated
- continuity state derives automatically as **Current**
- historical lapse visibility remains intact
- no notifications or actions are triggered

Recording a touchpoint does **not**:
- initiate outreach
- notify the subscriber
- change account status
- affect audits, content, or billing

---

## 8. Explicit Prohibitions

The following must **never** be recorded as touchpoints:

- automated emails, SMS, or DMs
- system reminders or notifications
- content publication or tagging
- social media reactions
- internal review activity
- messages written by AI

If intent was automated, the touchpoint does not exist.

---

## 9. If No Touchpoint Occurred

Do nothing.

Lapse visibility is correct by design.  
Continuity must never be simulated.

---

## 10. Compliance Reminder

Improper recording:
- corrupts cadence
- invalidates P5 state derivation
- undermines trust
- constitutes a governance violation

Accuracy outranks appearance.

---

## 11. Lock Statement

> **Record what occurred.  
> Do not record what should have occurred.**

This SOP is binding.
