# RCF Quality Assurance Checklist
## Internal Use — Relationship Continuity Framework

### Purpose
This checklist verifies that the Relationship Continuity Framework (RCF)
is being executed correctly and without drift.

This checklist is evaluative, not instructional.

---

## Eligibility Check
- [ ] Account status is ACTIVE
- [ ] Day 00 orientation was completed
- [ ] Continuity cadence was explicitly communicated
- [ ] First Progress Snapshot timing was confirmed

---

## Cadence Integrity
- [ ] Continuity follows an account-based cycle (not calendar-based)
- [ ] All five continuity components are present
- [ ] Components execute in the fixed order
- [ ] No component was skipped silently
- [ ] Any delays were acknowledged explicitly

---

## Silence Audit
- [ ] No unexplained gaps between continuity components
- [ ] Subscriber did not need to chase updates
- [ ] Presence was maintained between milestones
- [ ] Silence was never used as a fallback state

---

## Progress Snapshot Quality
- [ ] Snapshot was narrative-first
- [ ] Directional movement was named
- [ ] Metrics did not replace meaning
- [ ] Snapshot established forward expectation
- [ ] Snapshot arrived within the 28–30 day window

---

## Review & Conversation Quality
- [ ] Guided / Alignment conversation followed a consistent structure
- [ ] Conversation confirmed meaning, not just activity
- [ ] No delivery or performance guarantees were introduced
- [ ] Conversation reinforced continuity, not urgency

---

## Recognition & Status Integrity
- [ ] Recognition was tied to actual progress
- [ ] Recognition was contextual, not performative
- [ ] Recognition was paced appropriately
- [ ] No comparison or hierarchy was introduced

---

## Boundary Compliance
- [ ] P5 did not execute P3 or P4 actions
- [ ] Continuity was not conditioned on outcomes
- [ ] RCF was not reframed as sales or referral activity
- [ ] No SOP or GD boundaries were violated

---

## Overall Assessment
- [ ] Continuity feels predictable
- [ ] Subscriber expectations remain aligned
- [ ] Momentum is visible without pressure
- [ ] Renewal friction risk is LOW

---

## Escalation Trigger
If two or more items above are unchecked:
- flag continuity risk
- review cadence integrity
- correct execution before next cycle
