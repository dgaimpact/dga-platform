# Interpret Continuity Visibility

Standard Operating Procedure for interpreting continuity visibility within P5 — Relationship Continuity

Version: v1.0  
Created: 2025-12-29  
Status: Active

Applies To:
- DGA Core Platform operators
- Any human acting under DGA authority who views P5 continuity status

Primary Pillar:
- P5 — Relationship Continuity

Governing Authority:
- BP–P5–Relationship-Continuity.md
- REG–P5–Relationship-Continuity.md
- All ED–P5–Relationship-Continuity Execution Doctrines

---

## 1. Purpose

This SOP defines **how humans are permitted to interpret P5 continuity visibility**.

It exists to:
- prevent misinterpretation of time-based signals
- eliminate urgency, judgment, or performance inference
- ensure visibility supports awareness, not pressure
- preserve the non-optimizing intent of P5

This SOP governs **interpretation only**.  
It does not mandate action.

---

## 2. When This SOP Applies

Use this SOP whenever you:

- view a continuity state (Current, Approaching Lapse, Lapsed)
- see elapsed-time indicators
- encounter continuity reminders or flags
- review lists or summaries surfaced by P5 systems

Do **not** use this SOP:
- to decide outreach strategy
- to assess relationship quality
- to evaluate performance or risk
- to justify action elsewhere

---

## 3. What This SOP Is (and Is Not)

### What This SOP *Is*

- A neutral interpretation guide
- A restraint mechanism
- A reminder of P5 boundaries

### What This SOP *Is Not*

- An escalation playbook
- A prioritization framework
- A performance signal
- A directive to act

---

## 4. Canonical Interpretation Rules

### 4.1 Time Is the Only Signal

Continuity visibility communicates **elapsed time only**.

It does not communicate:
- satisfaction
- engagement
- trust
- risk
- importance
- urgency

No inference beyond time is permitted.

---

### 4.2 Continuity States Are Descriptive

- **Current**  
  Indicates a human touchpoint occurred within the cadence window.

- **Approaching Lapse**  
  Indicates elapsed time has exceeded 60 days.

- **Lapsed**  
  Indicates elapsed time has exceeded 90 days.

States describe **time passage**, nothing more.

---

### 4.3 Visibility Is Not Expectation

Seeing a lapse:
- does not imply failure
- does not imply neglect
- does not imply obligation

Visibility exists so absence is not invisible.

---

## 5. Permitted Human Responses

Upon viewing continuity visibility, humans may:

- acknowledge the information
- consider context privately
- decide independently whether to act
- take no action

All responses are valid.

---

## 6. Prohibited Interpretations

You must not interpret continuity visibility as:

- a demand for outreach
- a measure of relationship health
- a risk indicator
- a priority signal
- a reflection of value or importance

If interpretation creates pressure, it violates P5.

---

## 7. Interaction With Other Work

Continuity visibility must **not** be used to:

- accelerate audits
- justify content actions
- influence account status
- trigger workflows
- explain outcomes

P5 is isolated by design.

---

## 8. Handling Discomfort With Lapse Visibility

Discomfort is expected.

Do **not**:
- backfill touchpoints
- adjust dates
- seek automation to “fix” lapse
- reinterpret the signal

Absence must remain visible to remain honest.

---

## 9. Compliance Reminder

Improper interpretation:
- undermines restraint
- reintroduces optimization pressure
- erodes trust
- violates P5 doctrine

Interpretation discipline is as important as data discipline.

---

## 10. Lock Statement

> **Visibility informs.  
> Meaning is a human choice.**

This SOP is binding.
