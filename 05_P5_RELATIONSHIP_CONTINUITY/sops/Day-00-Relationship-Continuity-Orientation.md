## Day 00 — Relationship Continuity Orientation

### Purpose

Day 00 establishes expectations for how relationship continuity operates.
It exists to prevent ambiguity, silence anxiety, and misaligned assumptions.

No progress is evaluated on Day 00.

---

### What Happens on Day 00

On activation, the following must be communicated clearly:

1. Relationship continuity operates on a **fixed monthly cycle**
2. The cycle is **account-based**, not calendar-based
3. The first Progress Snapshot will arrive approximately **30 days from activation**
4. Silence between milestones does not occur in this system
5. Continuity continues independent of short-term outcomes

### Continuity Explanation (Verbatim Script)

> “From today forward, you’ll experience a predictable monthly rhythm.
>  
> You won’t need to chase updates or wonder what’s happening.
>  
> About once a month, you’ll receive a Progress Snapshot that shows where things are moving.
> We’ll review that together, connect patterns across accounts, and maintain momentum between cycles.
>  
> If timing ever shifts, you’ll hear from us — silence isn’t how this works.”

### Explicit Non-Expectations

On Day 00, it must be stated that:

- no immediate results are promised
- no action is required from the subscriber
- no proactive check-ins are necessary
- continuity is system-driven, not reactive

---

### Day 00 Completion Condition

Day 00 is considered complete when:
- continuity cadence has been explained
- first snapshot timing is confirmed
- subscriber expectations are aligned

No further action is required until the first continuity milestone.
