## Month 3 — Continuity Review & Renewal Conversation

### Purpose
This conversation exists to confirm continuity alignment and determine whether
the relationship should continue compounding beyond the initial term.

It is not a performance review.
It is not a sales pitch.

---

### Framing (Open the Conversation)

> “We’re at the three-month mark, which is a natural pause point.
>  
> This isn’t about whether something ‘worked’ yet.
> It’s about whether the **continuity and momentum we’ve built**
> is something you want to keep in motion.”

---

### What to Review (Fixed Order)

1. **Continuity Experience**
   - “Have expectations been clear?”
   - “Has the rhythm felt predictable?”
   - “Have you ever wondered what was happening?”

2. **Progress Direction**
   - “Do you feel more anchored than you did at the start?”
   - “Does your visibility / positioning feel more coherent?”
   - “Is momentum clearer now than it was in Month 1?”

3. **Identity Shift**
   - “Do you feel more confident explaining what you’re building?”
   - “Does this work feel like it’s reinforcing your professional position?”

### Reframing Renewal (Core Language)

> “At this stage, the real question isn’t whether we stop.
>  
> It’s whether we allow the momentum that’s forming to compound,
> or whether we reset and give that up.”

Pause. Let them respond.

---

### Renewal Positioning (If Aligned)

> “Continuing simply means keeping the continuity intact.
>  
> The structure doesn’t change.
> The rhythm doesn’t change.
> What changes is the depth of compounding.”

---

### If Hesitation Exists

> “That’s useful to know.
>  
> If something feels unclear or misaligned, this is the right moment
> to adjust — not to push forward blindly.”

No pressure.
No urgency.
No incentives.

---

### Close (Regardless of Outcome)

> “Either way, I appreciate how deliberately you’ve shown up.
>  
> Continuity only works when both sides value it.”

---

### Renewal Decision Rule

- If continuity is valued → proceed
- If continuity feels unnecessary → pause respectfully
- No attempt to re-sell or rescue
