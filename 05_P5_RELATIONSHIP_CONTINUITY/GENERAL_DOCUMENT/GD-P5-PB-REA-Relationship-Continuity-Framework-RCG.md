# PB-REA Relationship Continuity Framework (RCF)

Relationship Continuity Framework for PB-REA Partner Ecosystems

Version: v1.0  
Created: 2025-01-30  
Document Type: GENERAL (GD)

---

## Purpose

This document defines the **Relationship Continuity Framework (RCF)** as a
structural model for maintaining professional partner relationships over time
within a PB-REA context.

RCF exists to provide clarity, consistency, and continuity in partner
relationships independent of transactions, campaigns, or referral events.

---

## Context

PB-REA subscribers operate within relationship-driven ecosystems where
long-term trust, relevance, and recall matter more than frequency of contact.

RCF provides a neutral structure for sustaining those relationships without
relying on ad-hoc communication or transactional touchpoints.

---

## Scope

This framework applies to:
- PB-REA partner ecosystems
- referral-based professional relationships
- curated partner and peer groups

This framework defines **structure**, not execution.

---

## Non-Scope

RCF does not define:
- sales processes
- referral solicitation tactics
- marketing workflows
- performance expectations
- execution instructions

Any “how-to” guidance must exist in separate SOP or playbook documents.

---

## Core Principle

Professional relationships compound through **predictable presence**, not
transactional contact.

---

## Framework Structure

RCF consists of four structural components:

1. **Partner Progress Snapshot**  
   A continuity artifact that establishes shared context and situational
   awareness between partners.

2. **Alignment Conversation**  
   A structured interaction that maintains relevance and directional alignment.

3. **Curated Group Discussion**  
   An intentional discussion among selected partners to surface shared patterns,
   challenges, or opportunities.

4. **Quiet Validation Touchpoint**  
   A low-noise acknowledgment that reinforces relationship presence without
   agenda or demand.

These components function as a unified system.
No component is intended to operate independently.

---

## Structural Characteristics

RCF is characterized by:
- predictable cadence
- named relationship components
- low-noise interaction design
- non-performative presence
- relationship-first orientation

---

## Relationship Risk Definition

Within this framework, **silence between continuity components** represents a
relationship risk state.

RCF exists to prevent silence from becoming the default relationship behavior.

---

## Adaptation Boundary

RCF defines relationship structure only.

Execution details, cadence specifics, scripts, examples, and workflows must be
defined in separate SOP or playbook documents if required.

---

## Attribution

This framework is derived from the DGA Relationship Continuity Framework (RCF)
and adapted for PB-REA partner relationship contexts.

No internal DGA systems, automation, or enforcement mechanisms are required to
apply this framework.
