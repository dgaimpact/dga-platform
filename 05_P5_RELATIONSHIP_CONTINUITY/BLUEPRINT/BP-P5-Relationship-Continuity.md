# Relationship Continuity

Canonical Blueprint defining the intent, boundaries, and invariants of P5 — Relationship Continuity

Version: v1.0  
Created: 2025-12-29  
Status: Governing Authority (Active)

Primary Pillar: P5 — Relationship Continuity  
Consumed By:
- ED–P5–Relationship-Continuity–* (all execution doctrines)
- P5 Systems, SOPs, Guides (downstream only)

Governing Authority:
- 00_FOUNDATIONS/GOVERNANCE/DGA_BUSINESS_MODEL.md
- 00_FOUNDATIONS/GOVERNANCE/PILLAR_LOCK_REFERENCE.md

## FOUNDER DOCTRINE

P5 exists to protect the **human layer** of DGA from optimization, automation, and performance pressure.

As systems scale, the temptation is to measure, score, accelerate, and intervene.  
P5 exists to refuse that temptation.

If P5 becomes efficient, it has failed.  
If P5 becomes measurable, it has failed.  
If P5 becomes automated, it has failed.

Presence is sufficient.  
Restraint is the mechanism.  
Trust is preserved by not touching it.

---

## 1. Purpose & Authority

This Blueprint defines **why P5 exists** and **what it is allowed to govern**.

It establishes:
- the intent behind Relationship Continuity
- the non-negotiable boundaries of the pillar
- the invariants all downstream execution must obey

This Blueprint is **authoritative**.

If an Execution Doctrine, SOP, system, or automation conflicts with this Blueprint, the conflict must be resolved here.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

As DGA scales, three risks emerge:

1. Relationships become invisible between moments of execution  
2. Automation replaces intent under the guise of “helpfulness”  
3. Performance pressure leaks into human interactions  

Most systems respond by:
- scoring relationships
- triggering outreach
- optimizing cadence
- measuring “health”

These responses **destroy trust**.

P5 exists to solve a different problem:

> **How do we ensure relationships never go cold without turning them into systems?**

---

## 3. Scope — What This Blueprint Governs

This Blueprint governs:

- the definition of relationship continuity
- what “presence” means inside DGA
- how time is used as the only signal
- the refusal to optimize human relationships
- the boundary between visibility and action

P5 governs **continuity of presence**, nothing more.

---

## 4. Explicit Exclusions — What This Blueprint Does NOT Govern

This Blueprint explicitly does **not** govern:

- outreach tactics or scripts
- performance expectations
- engagement optimization
- satisfaction measurement
- retention strategy
- CRM workflows
- automation design details
- tooling selection

Those concerns are intentionally excluded.

---

## 5. Core Definitions (Conceptual)

### Relationship Continuity  
Sustained human presence over time, measured only by elapsed time since last contact.

### Presence  
The fact that a human showed up — not how, why, or with what result.

### Absence  
The passage of time without presence. Absence is observable and sufficient.

---

## 6. Foundational Principles

1. **Time is the only signal**  
   Meaning, sentiment, and outcomes are not observable without distortion.

2. **Humans own intent**  
   Systems may remember; they may not decide or act.

3. **Visibility without pressure**  
   Awareness must never become urgency.

4. **Continuity is not performance**  
   Showing up is not something to optimize.

5. **Trust is fragile**  
   The safest action is often restraint.

---

## 7. Invariants & Non-Negotiables

The following must always be true:

- no automated relationship outreach
- no relationship scoring or health metrics
- no outcome-based escalation
- no urgency language
- no AI-generated personal messaging
- no cadence acceleration
- no proxying of human intent

Violation of any invariant invalidates execution.

---

## 8. Pillar Ownership & Responsibilities

**P5 owns:**
- definition of continuity
- time-based visibility
- escalation as awareness only
- protection against automation creep

**P5 does not own:**
- action
- outcomes
- interpretation
- persuasion
- optimization

Ownership ends at awareness.

---

## 9. Relationships to Other Pillars

- **P1 / P2:** No interaction  
- **P3 (Audit):** Visibility only; no influence  
- **P4 (Content):** Visibility only; no justification or acceleration  

P5 is isolated by design.

---

## 10. Downstream Enforcement & Consumption Rules

Downstream artifacts must:
- consume P5 as read-only truth
- obey all execution doctrines
- refuse to act automatically

If an artifact requires action, it is outside P5.

---

## 11. Change, Replacement & Persistence Rules

This Blueprint:
- is versioned
- is durable
- changes rarely

Change requires:
- explicit founder review
- documented rationale
- downstream impact assessment

P5 must remain boring to remain trustworthy.

---

## 12. Compliance & Auditability

P5 compliance is validated by:
- absence of automation
- absence of scoring
- clarity of boundaries
- inspectable restraint

If restraint cannot be verified, P5 has failed.

---

## 13. Lock Statement

> **P5 is the place where DGA chooses not to act.**  
> **That choice is what preserves trust.**

This Blueprint is authoritative and binding.
