## 1. Purpose

This library exists to **control language** used to describe P5 — Relationship Continuity.

It exists to:
- prevent semantic drift at the relationship layer
- eliminate urgency, optimization, or performance framing
- ensure consistency across systems, SOPs, and guides
- protect trust by constraining how continuity is described

This library is **non-executing** and **non-procedural**.

---

## 2. What Belongs in the Content Library

This folder may contain:

- canonical definitions (plain-language)
- approved UI copy fragments
- reminder wording templates (informational only)
- explanatory blurbs for audits or diligence
- glossary entries for internal use

All content must remain **descriptive, neutral, and time-based**.

---

## 3. What Is Explicitly Forbidden

The Content Library must **never** include:

- scripts or outreach templates
- persuasive language
- urgency or consequence framing
- “best practices” for relationship management
- motivational or performance-oriented copy
- instructions or calls to action

If language encourages action, it does not belong here.

---

## 4. Canonical Language Principles

All P5 language must:

- describe time, not meaning
- avoid verbs implying obligation
- avoid risk or value judgments
- remain emotionally neutral
- be equally valid if ignored

Language must support awareness, not pressure.

---

## 5. Approved Terminology (Locked)

The following terms are canonical and must not be altered:

- Relationship Continuity  
- Human Touchpoint  
- Last Touchpoint Date  
- Continuity State  
- Current  
- Approaching Lapse  
- Lapsed  

No synonyms or replacements are permitted.

---

## 6. Prohibited Terminology

The following terms must never appear in P5 context:

- health
- score
- risk
- priority
- overdue
- urgent
- engagement
- nurture
- retention
- performance
- optimize

Use of prohibited terminology constitutes a violation.

---

## 7. Usage by Artifact Type

- **Systems / UI**  
  Use only approved copy fragments

- **Reminders**  
  Use time-descriptive, verb-free language

- **SOPs**  
  Reference terminology without interpretation

- **Guides**  
  Explain concepts without persuasion

---

## 8. Review & Change Control

All additions to this library require:

- review against P5 doctrines
- confirmation of neutrality
- removal of implied action
- version increment if modified

Language drift is treated as scope drift.

---

## 9. Lock Statement

> **Language shapes behavior.  
> P5 language is restrained by design.**

This library is locked.
