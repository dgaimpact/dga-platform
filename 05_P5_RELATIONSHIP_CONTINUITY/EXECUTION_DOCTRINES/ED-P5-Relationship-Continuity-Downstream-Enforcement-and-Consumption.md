## 1. Authority & Intent

This Execution Doctrine defines **how P5 may be consumed downstream** and **how its constraints are enforced**.

It exists to:
- prevent reinterpretation of P5 intent in SOPs or systems
- lock P5 semantics before operationalization
- ensure all downstream artifacts remain subordinate
- eliminate backdoor automation or scope expansion

This document is **binding**.

If a downstream artifact requires reinterpretation of P5 rules, the artifact is invalid.

---

## 2. Canonical Consumption Rule

> **P5 may be observed, surfaced, and acknowledged — never acted upon automatically.**

This rule applies universally.

---

## 3. Permitted Downstream Consumers

The following artifact types may consume P5 data or states.

---

### 3.1 P5 Execution Doctrines

Permitted usage:
- reference definitions verbatim
- enforce cadence and state logic
- constrain system behavior

Prohibited:
- redefining cadence
- redefining states
- introducing new data fields

---

### 3.2 P5 Systems & Dashboards

Permitted usage:
- display continuity state
- show elapsed time
- surface signals and escalation visibility

Prohibited:
- initiating actions
- ranking relationships
- applying priority or urgency
- suggesting next steps

---

### 3.3 P5 SOPs (Human Procedures)

Permitted usage:
- explain how humans should interpret visibility
- outline optional human responses
- reinforce non-automation principles

Prohibited:
- mandated outreach timelines
- scripts or message templates
- performance expectations
- outcome-based instructions

SOPs must support judgment, not replace it.

---

### 3.4 Guides & Enablement Materials

Permitted usage:
- human-readable explanation of P5 concepts
- reassurance around continuity expectations
- framing of presence as trust-building

Prohibited:
- tactics
- persuasion frameworks
- “how to save the relationship” guidance

---

## 4. Cross-Pillar Consumption (Strictly Limited)

Other pillars may consume P5 **visibility only**.

---

### P3 — Audit

- May observe that continuity exists or lapsed
- May not alter audit cadence or interpretation

---

### P4 — Content Creation & Publishing

- May observe existence of continuity
- May not accelerate, delay, or justify content actions

---

### P1 / P2

- No consumption permitted

---

## 5. Enforcement Mechanisms

P5 enforcement relies on:

- schema constraints
- execution doctrine alignment
- prohibition of outbound automation
- human confirmation requirements

Enforcement must be:
- preventive
- structural
- non-reactive

---

## 6. Prohibited Enforcement Patterns

The following are permanently prohibited:

- enforcing outreach quotas
- enforcing touchpoint frequency beyond cadence visibility
- tying continuity to account status
- penalizing lapse
- rewarding “good continuity”

Continuity is presence, not performance.

---

## 7. Violation Handling

If a downstream artifact violates P5 constraints:

1. The artifact is deemed non-compliant  
2. Execution must stop  
3. The artifact must be corrected or removed  
4. No compensatory automation is permitted  

Violations are governance failures, not edge cases.

---

## 8. Dependency Declaration

This doctrine must be reviewed before:
- finalizing any P5 SOP
- approving any P5 UI
- integrating P5 data with other systems

No downstream work is considered valid without alignment.

---

## 9. Change Control

Changes to downstream consumption rules require:
- confirmation of human/system boundary integrity
- explicit review against Scope & Non-Scope
- version increment
- documented rationale

Consumption creep is treated as scope creep.

---

## 10. Lock Statement

> **P5 sets the boundary.  
> Downstream artifacts obey it.**

This enforcement model is locked.
