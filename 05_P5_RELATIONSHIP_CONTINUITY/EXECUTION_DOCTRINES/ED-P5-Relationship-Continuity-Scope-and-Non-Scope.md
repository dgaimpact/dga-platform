Version: v1.0  
Created: 2025-12-29  
Status: Binding (Active)

Applies To:
- DGA Core Platform
- All human operators acting under DGA authority
- All systems, prompts, reminders, or signals referencing “relationship,” “check-in,” or “continuity”

Governing Authority:
- 00_FOUNDATIONS/GOVERNANCE/DGA_BUSINESS_MODEL.md
- 00_FOUNDATIONS/GOVERNANCE/PILLAR_LOCK_REFERENCE.md

Governed By:
- P5 — Relationship Continuity (Pillar Reference)
- BP–P3–Omni-Presence-Blueprint (boundary constraints only)

---

## 1. Authority & Scope

This Execution Doctrine defines the **authoritative scope and non-scope** of **P5 — Relationship Continuity**.

It exists to:
- prevent scope bleed from adjacent pillars
- explicitly constrain what P5 may and may not own
- establish a hard boundary before any workflows, systems, or automation are designed
- preserve human trust by eliminating ambiguity at the relationship layer

This document is **binding**.

If a system, SOP, automation, or human action contradicts the scope rules defined here, the system or action is invalid.

---

## 1.1 Pillar Ownership Declaration

This Execution Doctrine operates **exclusively within the following DGA Pillar**:

- **Primary Pillar:** P5 — Relationship Continuity

P5 may **consume signals** from other pillars but must never:
- execute actions owned by another pillar
- reinterpret upstream intent
- perform downstream execution
- infer outcomes, sentiment, or performance

---

## 2. Core Purpose of P5 (Declarative)

P5 exists to govern **how DGA maintains human presence and continuity over time** with ACTIVE subscribers.

P5 answers one question only:

> “Has DGA shown up, as a human system, with appropriate continuity?”

P5 does **not** answer:
- whether outcomes occurred
- whether performance improved
- whether the subscriber is satisfied
- whether content or audits are effective

Presence is the unit of truth.  
Outcomes are explicitly out of scope.

---

## 3. IN-SCOPE — What P5 Explicitly Owns

P5 owns **only** the following domains.

### 3.1 Relationship Continuity Definition

- Definition of what constitutes a *meaningful human touchpoint*
- Definition of acceptable continuity windows (e.g., 60–90 days)
- Declaration of presence states (e.g., current, approaching lapse, lapsed)

P5 defines **presence**, not engagement quality.

---

### 3.2 Human-Led Touchpoint Categories

P5 owns the classification of **human actions**, including:

- live conversations
- check-in calls
- scheduled or ad-hoc meetings
- informal relationship touchpoints (e.g., coffee)

P5 does not judge content, outcomes, or tone — only occurrence.

---

### 3.3 Continuity Tracking (Status-Only)

P5 owns **binary and temporal tracking** of:

- last human touchpoint date
- elapsed time since last touchpoint
- continuity state based on elapsed time

Tracking is:
- descriptive
- non-scored
- non-comparative

---

### 3.4 Escalation Signaling (Human-Only)

P5 owns **signals** that indicate:

- a relationship is approaching a lapse
- a relationship has gone cold
- human attention is required

Signals may:
- notify
- flag
- surface visibility

Signals must **never**:
- trigger automated outreach
- send messages on behalf of a human
- infer intent or sentiment

---

### 3.5 Guardrails Against Automation of Intent

P5 owns the enforcement of the following guardrail:

> **Human intent must never be automated.**

This includes prohibitions against:
- automated relationship emails
- automated check-ins
- AI-generated “personal” messages
- system-initiated relationship repair

---

## 4. OUT-OF-SCOPE — What P5 Explicitly Does NOT Own

The following are **explicitly excluded** from P5 under all circumstances.

---

### 4.1 Prospecting & Qualification

P5 does **not** own:
- lead nurturing
- prospect follow-up
- qualification sequences
- pre-ACTIVE relationship handling

Ownership belongs to **P1** and **P2**.

---

### 4.2 Audit Execution or Interpretation

P5 does **not** own:
- audit cadence
- audit review
- audit discussion framing
- interpretation of audit results

Ownership belongs to **P3**.

---

### 4.3 Content Creation, Publishing, or Discussion

P5 does **not** own:
- content planning
- content performance review
- editorial discussions
- publishing cadence
- content explanation or defense

Ownership belongs to **P4**.

---

### 4.4 CRM Performance Tracking

P5 does **not** own:
- activity scoring
- engagement metrics
- task completion rates
- conversion tracking
- success attribution

P5 tracks **presence only**, not productivity.

---

### 4.5 Outcome Enforcement or Satisfaction Measurement

P5 does **not** own:
- satisfaction surveys
- NPS
- retention analysis
- churn prediction
- relationship “health scores”

Human trust is not quantifiable inside DGA systems.

---

### 4.6 Automated Messaging of Any Kind

P5 must **never**:
- send automated emails
- send automated SMS
- send automated DMs
- auto-generate “check-in” language

If a message is sent, a human must consciously send it.

---

## 5. Boundary Rules (Non-Negotiable)

The following rules apply universally.

1. P5 may **observe time**, never interpret sentiment  
2. P5 may **signal need**, never act on it  
3. P5 may **record presence**, never judge value  
4. P5 may **support humans**, never replace them  
5. P5 must remain outcome-agnostic at all times  

Violation of any rule invalidates the implementation.

---

## 6. Interaction With Other Pillars

### P5 ← P1 / P2  
- No interaction permitted

### P5 ← P3  
- May consume audit timing signals only
- May not discuss, interpret, or act on audits

### P5 ← P4  
- May observe content cadence existence (yes/no)
- May not discuss content substance or results

### P5 → Any Pillar  
- No upstream influence permitted

---

## 7. Prohibited Design Patterns

The following patterns are permanently prohibited within P5:

- “Relationship health scores”
- AI-generated personal messages
- Automated follow-ups “on behalf of”
- Engagement-based escalation
- Outcome-driven prioritization
- Performance-linked continuity

If continuity depends on performance, trust is already broken.

---

## 8. Downstream Dependency Declaration

This doctrine **must be satisfied** before:

- any P5 Execution Doctrines are written
- any P5 systems are designed
- any P5 automations are proposed
- any P5 SOPs are drafted

All downstream artifacts must cite this document as the scope authority.

---

## 9. Change Control

Changes to this Execution Doctrine require:

- confirmation that P4 → P5 boundary remains intact
- explicit review against the DGA Business Model
- version increment
- documented rationale

Silent scope expansion is prohibited.

---

## 10. Lock Statement

> **P5 governs presence, not performance.**  
> **It protects the human layer by refusing to automate intent.**  
>  
> Any system that violates this principle is misaligned with DGA and must be corrected or removed.
