Version: v1.0  
Created: 2025-12-29  
Status: Binding (Locked)

Applies To:
- DGA Core Platform
- All current and future P5 artifacts
- All humans, systems, and automations interacting with P5

Governing Authority:
- 00_FOUNDATIONS/GOVERNANCE/DGA_BUSINESS_MODEL.md
- 00_FOUNDATIONS/GOVERNANCE/PILLAR_LOCK_REFERENCE.md

Governed By:
- P5 — Relationship Continuity (Pillar Reference)
- All ED–P5–Relationship-Continuity doctrines listed below

---

## 1. Authority & Purpose

This Execution Doctrine **formally locks P5 — Relationship Continuity**.

It exists to:
- declare P5 definition complete at the doctrine level
- prevent further conceptual expansion without explicit review
- mark the transition point from *definition* to *design*
- establish a single reference checkpoint for all future P5 work

This document is **binding and final**.

No P5 system, SOP, automation, or guide may be created or modified unless it conforms to this lock.

---

## 2. Canonical P5 Doctrine Set (Authoritative)

P5 is fully and exclusively defined by the following Execution Doctrines:

1. **ED–P5–Relationship-Continuity–Scope-&-Non-Scope**  
2. **ED–P5–Relationship-Continuity–Core-Definitions**  
3. **ED–P5–Relationship-Continuity–Cadence-Rules**  
4. **ED–P5–Relationship-Continuity–Signals-&-Escalation**  
5. **ED–P5–Relationship-Continuity–State-&-Data-Rules**  
6. **ED–P5–Relationship-Continuity–Human-vs-System-Responsibilities**  
7. **ED–P5–Relationship-Continuity–Automation-Constraints**  
8. **ED–P5–Relationship-Continuity–Downstream-Enforcement-&-Consumption**  
9. **ED–P5–Relationship-Continuity–Compliance-&-Auditability**

No additional doctrines may be introduced without reopening this lock.

---

## 3. What “Locked” Means (Explicit)

Locking P5 means:

- scope is complete
- terminology is fixed
- cadence is immutable
- data model is minimal and final
- automation boundaries are absolute
- human/system roles are non-negotiable

Locking does **not** mean:
- systems are designed
- SOPs are written
- tooling is selected
- workflows are implemented

Those are downstream activities.

---

## 4. Prohibited Post-Lock Activity

The following actions are prohibited unless this lock is formally lifted:

- adding new P5 concepts or states
- introducing qualitative relationship data
- redefining cadence or escalation
- expanding automation permissions
- blending P5 with CRM or performance logic
- reinterpreting P5 intent in SOPs

If a need cannot be met within the locked definition, the need is out of scope.

---

## 5. Reopening the Lock (Formal Only)

The P5 lock may be reopened **only** if:

1. A structural failure is identified  
2. The failure cannot be resolved within existing doctrines  
3. A formal review is initiated  
4. Impact on all pillars is assessed  
5. This document is versioned and replaced  

Silent exceptions are forbidden.

---

## 6. Transition Statement

> **P5 is now defined.  
> From this point forward, P5 work is execution-only.**

All future activity must:
- consume the locked doctrine set
- obey all constraints
- treat P5 as a boundary system

---

## 7. Final Lock Statement

> **P5 exists to preserve the human layer by refusing to optimize it.**  
> **Presence is sufficient. Automation is not.**

This lock is in effect.
