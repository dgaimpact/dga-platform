## 1. Authority & Intent

This Execution Doctrine defines the **non-negotiable cadence rules** governing Relationship Continuity in P5.

It exists to:
- enforce predictable human presence
- prevent reactive or performance-driven outreach
- eliminate cadence ambiguity before any tooling or automation exists
- protect trust by standardizing *when* presence occurs, not *why*

This document is **binding**.

If a system or human action violates these cadence rules, the implementation is invalid.

---

## 2. Cadence Philosophy (Declarative)

Relationship continuity is governed by **time**, not activity volume or outcomes.

Cadence exists to ensure:
- absence is prevented
- relationships do not silently decay
- DGA remains predictably present

Cadence does **not** exist to:
- optimize engagement
- respond to performance
- accelerate based on results
- compensate for missed execution elsewhere

---

## 3. Canonical Continuity Cadence

### 3.1 Standard Cadence Window

The canonical continuity window for P5 is:

- **60–90 days**

This window applies uniformly to:
- Solo (SO) subscribers
- Playbook (PB) subscribers
- Enterprise (EN) seats

No plan type alters cadence expectations.

---

### 3.2 Cadence Interpretation Rules

- A Human Touchpoint **resets** the continuity clock
- Multiple touchpoints within a window do **not** extend the next window
- Cadence is measured from the **Last Touchpoint Date** only

Cadence must never be:
- rolling based on engagement
- shortened due to perceived urgency
- extended due to perceived stability

---

## 4. Approaching-Lapse Threshold

### Approaching Lapse

A relationship enters **Approaching Lapse** when:

- elapsed time since last Human Touchpoint exceeds **60 days**

This threshold exists to:
- surface awareness
- allow human planning
- avoid reactive outreach

No action is implied or required.

---

## 5. Lapse Threshold

### Lapsed

A relationship enters **Lapsed** status when:

- elapsed time since last Human Touchpoint exceeds **90 days**

Lapse indicates:
- continuity failure
- absence of human presence

Lapse does **not** indicate:
- dissatisfaction
- disengagement
- failure of audits or content
- relationship risk beyond time elapsed

---

## 6. Prohibited Cadence Modifiers

The following must **never** alter cadence:

- audit results
- content volume or cadence
- subscriber responsiveness
- perceived enthusiasm
- performance metrics
- subscription tier
- revenue contribution

Time is the sole determinant.

---

## 7. Make-Up Touchpoints (Explicitly Forbidden)

Missed cadence windows must **never** be compensated by:

- stacked calls
- rapid follow-ups
- accelerated outreach
- “checking in again” messages

A late touchpoint:
- resets the clock
- does not erase lapse history

---

## 8. Parallel Relationships (PB Context)

For Playbook (PB) subscribers:

- Cadence applies **independently** per relationship
- One relationship’s touchpoint does not satisfy another’s cadence
- No aggregation or proxying is permitted

Each relationship stands alone.

---

## 9. System Handling Rules

Systems may:
- calculate elapsed time
- surface cadence state
- flag approaching lapse or lapse

Systems must **never**:
- initiate outreach
- suggest language
- prioritize based on outcomes
- rank relationships

---

## 10. Downstream Dependency Declaration

This doctrine must be enforced before:
- P5 Execution Doctrines defining signals or states
- P5 systems or dashboards
- P5 automations (reminders only)
- P5 SOPs

Cadence logic must not be redefined downstream.

---

## 11. Change Control

Changes to cadence rules require:
- Business Model review
- explicit founder approval
- version increment
- documented rationale

Cadence drift is treated as trust erosion.

---

## 12. Lock Statement

> **Cadence protects relationships by removing discretion.**  
> **When timing becomes negotiable, presence becomes optional.**

This cadence is locked.
