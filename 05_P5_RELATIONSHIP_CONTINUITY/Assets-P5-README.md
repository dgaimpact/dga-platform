## 1. Purpose

This README defines **what assets may exist** under P5 and how they may be used.

It exists to:
- prevent assets from becoming instructional or persuasive
- ensure assets support understanding without directing behavior
- keep P5 materials non-operational and neutral
- maintain alignment with the locked P5 doctrine set

This document is **descriptive**, not procedural.

---

## 2. What Belongs in ASSETS/

Permitted asset types include:

- diagrams illustrating P5 boundaries (human vs system)
- flow visuals showing time-based state derivation (non-operational)
- governance or audit reference charts
- glossary visuals or relationship maps (non-evaluative)
- diligence-ready summaries for reviewers

Assets must be **explanatory**, not actionable.

---

## 3. What Is Explicitly Forbidden

Assets must **never** include:

- step-by-step workflows
- screenshots implying buttons or actions
- prompts, scripts, or templates
- performance dashboards
- urgency indicators or heat maps
- comparative visuals ranking relationships

If an asset implies action, it violates P5.

---

## 4. Design & Language Constraints

All assets must:

- use neutral labels
- avoid color implying urgency or risk
- avoid arrows that imply “next action”
- avoid metrics, scores, or progress indicators
- remain valid if no action is taken

Assets explain boundaries, not behavior.

---

## 5. Relationship to Other Folders

- **SYSTEMS/**  
  Defines what *may* be displayed (logic & constraints)

- **ASSETS/**  
  Illustrates *why* boundaries exist (conceptual only)

Assets must never duplicate or replace system specs.

---

## 6. Usage Contexts

Permitted usage contexts include:

- internal orientation
- governance reviews
- audit preparation
- investor or diligence walkthroughs (non-promotional)

Assets must not be repurposed for sales or persuasion.

---

## 7. Change Control

Any addition or modification requires:

- alignment check against all P5 doctrines
- confirmation of non-operational intent
- removal of any implied action
- version increment if modified

Asset drift is treated as scope drift.

---

## 8. Lock Statement

> **Assets may explain restraint.  
> They must never suggest behavior.**

This asset model is locked.
