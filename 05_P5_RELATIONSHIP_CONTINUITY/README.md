# P5 – README

Operational Guide for SOP governance within P5 — Relationship Continuity

Version: v1.1  
Created: 2025-12-14  
Last Updated: 2025-12-29  
Status: Reference (Active)

Applies To:
- All SOPs housed under OPS_SOPS/
- Any human acting under DGA authority who consumes or authors P5 SOPs

Primary Pillar:
- P5 — Relationship Continuity

Governing Authority:
- BP–P5–Relationship-Continuity.md
- REG–P5–Relationship-Continuity.md
- All ED–P5–Relationship-Continuity Execution Doctrines

## 1. Purpose

This document defines **how SOPs function inside P5** and the constraints they must obey.

It exists to:
- prevent SOPs from drifting into playbooks, scripts, or tactics
- enforce the locked human/system boundary
- ensure SOPs preserve restraint rather than introduce action pressure
- align all procedures with the finalized P5 doctrine set

This README is **governing**, not instructional.

---

## 2. What P5 SOPs Are Allowed to Do

P5 SOPs may only:

- define **mechanical procedures** (e.g., how to record a date)
- explain **how to interpret visibility** without inference
- restate canonical prohibitions and constraints
- support consistency and auditability
- reinforce that action is always optional and human-owned

P5 SOPs support **awareness discipline**, not behavior optimization.

---

## 3. What P5 SOPs Are Explicitly Forbidden to Do

P5 SOPs must never:

- instruct *when* to reach out
- suggest *how* to reach out
- include scripts, templates, or messaging guidance
- define success, failure, or expectations
- introduce urgency, priority, or consequence framing
- compensate for lapse visibility
- optimize continuity or outcomes

If an SOP tells a human *what to do next*, it violates P5.

---

## 4. Canonical P5 SOP Categories (Exhaustive)

Only the following SOP categories are permitted under P5:

1. **Recording SOPs**  
   Mechanical procedures for recording factual data  
   Example: `SOP–P5–Record-Human-Touchpoint`

2. **Interpretation SOPs**  
   Rules for reading visibility correctly without inference  
   Example: `SOP–P5–Interpret-Continuity-Visibility`

3. **Compliance / Inspection SOPs**  
   Procedures for validating adherence to P5 constraints  

No additional SOP categories may be introduced.

---

## 5. SOPs vs Guides (Critical Distinction)

- **SOPs**  
  - Binding  
  - Procedural  
  - Narrow  
  - Enforce rules

- **Guides**  
  - Explanatory  
  - Non-binding  
  - Human-readable  
  - Provide context only

If a document explains *why* rather than *how*, it is a **Guide**, not an SOP.

---

## 6. Relationship to Systems & Automation

All P5 SOPs must assume:

- systems are read-only
- automation is assistive only
- no tooling will initiate action
- no UI affordance implies obligation

SOPs must remain valid even if tooling changes.

---

## 7. Creating or Updating a P5 SOP

A P5 SOP may be created or revised only if:

1. The behavior cannot be governed by an existing SOP  
2. The SOP introduces no action guidance  
3. The SOP aligns with all locked P5 doctrines  
4. The SOP passes the P5 Compliance Checklist  

Failure of any condition invalidates the SOP.

---

## 8. Change Control

All SOP changes require:

- version increment
- confirmation against the P5 lock
- review for scope creep
- removal of any prescriptive or outcome-oriented language

SOP expansion is treated as scope expansion.

---

## 9. Lock Statement

> **P5 SOPs constrain behavior.  
> They never direct it.**

This operational model is locked.
