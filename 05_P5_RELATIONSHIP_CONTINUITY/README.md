## 1. Purpose of P5 — Relationship Continuity

P5 — Relationship Continuity governs **how DGA preserves human presence over time without automation, optimization, or performance pressure**.

This pillar exists to:
- ensure no ACTIVE subscriber relationship silently goes cold
- maintain predictable human presence without outcome expectations
- prevent relationships from becoming transactional, scored, or automated
- protect trust by refusing to optimize or systematize human intent

P5 is about **presence only**.  
It records *that* DGA showed up — never *why*, *how well*, or *with what result*.

---

## 2. What This Pillar Owns

P5 owns all systems, documents, and logic related to:

- the definition of *relationship continuity* as time-based presence
- canonical cadence rules (60–90 days)
- continuity states (Current · Approaching Lapse · Lapsed)
- recording of **human-confirmed** touchpoints only
- visibility-only signals and escalation
- enforcement of human-vs-system responsibility boundaries
- absolute prohibition of relationship automation

P5 defines **presence as sufficient** and refuses to measure beyond it.

---

## 3. What This Pillar Explicitly Does NOT Own

P5 does **not** own:

- prospecting, nurturing, or qualification (P1)
- intake, onboarding, or activation (P2)
- audits or audit interpretation (P3)
- content creation, publishing, or discussion (P4)
- CRM workflows, task management, or performance tracking
- satisfaction, engagement, retention, or “relationship health” metrics
- outreach tactics, scripts, or message templates
- automated messaging, sequencing, or re-engagement logic

If action, interpretation, or outcomes are required, ownership lies elsewhere.

### Subfolder Definitions

- **BLUEPRINTS/**  
  Founder intent, philosophy, invariants, and non-negotiable boundaries.

- **EXECUTION_DOCTRINES/**  
  Binding rules governing scope, definitions, cadence, states, signals, data, automation limits, compliance, and lock statements.

- **SYSTEMS/**  
  Visibility-only designs (status, elapsed time, awareness surfaces).

- **AUTOMATIONS/**  
  Assistive automation only (calculations, reminders, integrity checks).  
  No outbound communication. No decision-making.

- **OPS_SOPS/**  
  Human procedures explaining how to *interpret* visibility without mandating action.

- **TOOLS/**  
  Inspection and compliance utilities (non-executing).

- **ASSETS/**  
  Reference materials and supporting documentation.

---

## 5. Governing Constraints (Non-Negotiable)

- Time is the only signal
- Humans own intent; systems own visibility
- No automated relationship outreach of any kind
- No scoring, ranking, prioritization, or “health” indicators
- No urgency or consequence language
- No AI-generated personal messaging
- No cadence acceleration or performance linkage
- No cross-pillar action triggers

Violation of any constraint invalidates the implementation.

---

## 6. Key Principle

> **P5 protects trust by refusing to optimize relationships.**

This principle must remain true regardless of scale, tooling, or future team composition.
