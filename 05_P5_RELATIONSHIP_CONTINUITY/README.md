## 1. Purpose of P5 — Relationship Continuity

P5 — Relationship Continuity governs **how DGA shows up as a human system over time**.

This pillar exists to:
- ensure no ACTIVE subscriber relationship ever goes cold
- prevent DGA from becoming invisible, transactional, or purely automated
- protect trust, confidence, and long-term retention
- reinforce the value of consistency over novelty

P5 is about **presence**, not performance.  
It ensures continuity, not outcomes.

---

## 2. What This Pillar Owns

P5 owns all systems, documents, and logic related to:

- Human-led outreach cadence (60–90 day cycles)
- Relationship touchpoints (calls, meetings, check-ins, coffee)
- Continuity tracking (status, not scoring)
- Escalation signaling when relationships stall
- Guardrails that prevent automation of intent

P5 defines **how DGA remains human at scale**.

---

## 3. What This Pillar Explicitly Does NOT Own

P5 does **not** own:

- Prospect qualification or onboarding (P1 / P2)
- Audit execution or interpretation (P3)
- Content creation or publishing (P4)
- CRM-style performance tracking
- Automated outreach or messaging
- Outcome enforcement or guarantees

If a system attempts to *replace* human intent, it violates this pillar.

### Subfolder Definitions

- **BLUEPRINTS/**  
  Define relationship philosophy, intent, and non-negotiable boundaries.

- **EXECUTION_DOCTRINES/**  
  Enforce limits on automation, cadence rules, and escalation logic.

- **SYSTEMS/**  
  Logical designs that support visibility into relationship state without scoring.

- **AUTOMATIONS/**  
  Limited, supporting automations (reminders, flags, status prompts only).

- **OPS_SOPS/**  
  Human-executed procedures for outreach, follow-up, and escalation.

- **ASSETS/**  
  Reference materials, guidance notes, and non-executing support content.

---

## 5. Governing Constraints

- Human action must always precede system escalation
- No automated messaging may replace a human touchpoint
- Continuity tracking records *presence*, not performance
- Escalation signals inform humans — they do not act for them
- Relationship context must never be inferred by automation

Trust outranks efficiency.

---

## 6. Key Principle

> **P5 protects the relationship layer.  
> When relationships erode, systems lose meaning.**

DGA remains valuable because it stays human where it matters most.
