## Overview

This guide provides Mortgage Professionals with a structured framework for tracking REA partner performance and making data-informed "gut decisions" about when to continue or discontinue partnerships.

## The Performance Tracking Framework

### Three-Pillar Assessment System

| Pillar | Weight | What We Measure |
|--------|---------|-----------------|
| **Implementation** | 40% | REA's commitment to content execution |
| **Responsiveness** | 35% | REA's engagement and communication |
| **Referral Flow** | 25% | Business results and partnership value |

## Implementation Metrics (40%)

### Content Adoption Score
**How to Track:** Monthly review of REA's actual content posting vs. delivered content

**Scoring:**
- **A (90-100%):** Posts all content consistently, follows calendar
- **B (70-89%):** Posts most content, minor deviations
- **C (50-69%):** Inconsistent posting, frequent delays
- **D (Below 50%):** Rarely posts, minimal implementation

**Data Sources:**
- Social media monitoring tools
- Google Business Profile post history
- REA self-reporting during check-ins

### Quality of Execution
**How to Track:** Review of how well REA implements provided content

**Green Flags:**
- Uses suggested images and formatting
- Posts at recommended times
- Maintains consistent branding
- Engages with comments/responses

**Red Flags:**
- Poor formatting or broken links
- Posts at random times
- Modifies content in ways that reduce effectiveness
- No engagement with audience

## Responsiveness Metrics (35%)

### Communication Score
**How to Track:** Response times and engagement quality

**Scoring:**
- **A:** Responds within 4 hours, proactive communication
- **B:** Responds within 24 hours, generally engaged
- **C:** Responds within 48 hours, often needs follow-up
- **D:** Rarely responds, difficult to reach

### Partnership Engagement
**How to Track:** Active participation in the relationship

**Positive Indicators:**
- Attends scheduled check-ins
- Provides feedback on content
- Shares results and insights
- Proactive about partnership success

**Negative Indicators:**
- Misses scheduled calls

## Referral Flow Metrics (25%)

### Lead Generation & Conversion
**How to Track:** Actual business results from the partnership

**Quantitative Measures:**
- Number of referred leads per month
- Conversion rate of referred leads
- Quality of referred leads (fit, readiness)
- Revenue generated from partnership

**Qualitative Measures:**
- Are leads well-qualified?
- Does REA provide proper introductions?
- Is there mutual promotion happening?

## The Decision Matrix

### 30-Day Assessment (Initial Review)

**Purpose:** Validate early partnership viability

**Key Questions:**
- Is the REA implementing content consistently?
- Are they responsive to communication?
- Have we established a referral workflow?
- Do they understand the partnership expectations?

**Actions:**
- **Green Light:** Continue with current approach
- **Yellow Light:** Schedule performance conversation
- **Red Light:** Consider early termination

### 90-Day Performance Review (Critical Decision Point)

**Assessment Framework:**

| Score | Implementation | Responsiveness | Referrals | Decision | Action |
|-------|---------------|----------------|-----------|----------|---------|
| A | 90%+ | A | Consistent | **Expand** | Increase investment, add resources |
| B | 70-89% | B | Some | **Continue** | Maintain, provide coaching |
| C | 50-69% | C | Minimal | **Warning** | Performance conversation required |
| D | <50% | D | None | **Terminate** | Begin exit process |

### Ongoing Quarterly Reviews

**Purpose:** Continuous partnership optimization

**Review Elements:**
- Content performance analytics
- Referral quality and quantity
- Partnership satisfaction (both sides)
- Competitive landscape changes
- Opportunity for expansion

## The "Gut Decision" Framework

### When Your Gut Says "This Isn't Working"

**Validate Against Data:**
- Check the implementation metrics
- Review communication history
- Analyze referral patterns
- Compare to other successful partnerships

### Common Gut Feelings and Their Meanings

**"I'm Doing All the Work"**
- **Data Check:** Implementation score below 60%
- **Action:** Have direct conversation about partnership balance

**"They're Not Committed"**
- **Data Check:** Responsiveness score C or D
- **Action:** Clarify expectations and consequences

**"This Isn't Generating Business"**
- **Data Check:** Referral flow minimal after 90 days
- **Action:** Investigate why and make strategic decision

## Performance Conversation Scripts

### The "Yellow Light" Conversation

**Opening:**
"I want to check in on our partnership. The data shows [specific metric] isn't where we need it to be for mutual success. What's your perspective?"

**Middle:**
"My commitment is to drive visibility to your business, and I need to see [specific expectation] from your side to justify continuing the investment."

**Close:**
"Let's try this for 30 more days with clear targets. If we hit [specific metrics], we continue. If not, we may need to reconsider the partnership."

### The "Red Light" Conversation

**Opening:**
"After reviewing our partnership over the past [timeframe], it's clear this isn't delivering the mutual value we both need."

**Middle:**
"Despite my investment in your visibility, we're not seeing the [implementation/responsiveness/referrals] required for a sustainable partnership."

**Close:**
"I'll be winding down your content delivery over the next 30 days. I wish you the best in your business."
