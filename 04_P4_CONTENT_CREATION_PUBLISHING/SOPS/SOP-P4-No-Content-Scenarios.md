## 1. Purpose

This SOP defines **when the correct execution outcome is the intentional creation of no content**.

Its purpose is to:
- prevent forced or speculative publishing
- protect audit neutrality and authority integrity
- maintain subscriber trust
- reinforce governance-first execution discipline

No content is a **valid and often correct outcome**.

---

## 2. What This SOP Governs

This SOP governs:

- Conditions under which content must not be created
- How no-content decisions are reached and documented
- How no-content outcomes are communicated
- Enforcement rules preventing content pressure overrides

This SOP authorizes **intentional non-action**.

---

## 3. What This SOP Does *Not* Govern

This SOP does **not** govern:

- Content prioritization when content is warranted
- Temporary publishing delays
- Editorial quality decisions
- Performance evaluation

This SOP governs **whether content should exist at all**.

---

## 4. Canonical No-Content Scenarios

Content **must not be created** when any of the following conditions apply.

---

### 4.1 Entity Not Ready

- Entity has not satisfied the P2 Entity Readiness Checklist
- Provisional intake items materially affect interpretation
- Governance acknowledgment is incomplete

**Rationale:**  
Content without readiness introduces misattribution and risk.

---

### 4.2 Insufficient Audit Signal

- Audit artifacts show sparse, ambiguous, or unstable signals
- Observations do not support meaningful expression
- Signals are contradictory or non-corroborated

**Rationale:**  
Expression without observation is speculation.

---

### 4.3 Neutral or Saturated Authority State

- Entity authority signals are already consistent and stable
- No meaningful gaps or opportunities are observed
- Content would be redundant or noise-generating

**Rationale:**  
More content does not equal more authority.

---

### 4.4 Governance Constraint

- Publishing would violate destination or attribution constraints
- Content would blur ownership between DGA and subscriber
- Content would imply outcomes, guarantees, or advice

**Rationale:**  
Governance overrides output.

---

### 4.5 Misaligned Intent or Pressure

- Content request is driven by anxiety, timelines, or expectation pressure
- Content is requested to “do something” absent justification
- Content would serve reassurance rather than truth

**Rationale:**  
Content must not be used as emotional compensation.

---

## 5. Decision & Documentation

When a no-content decision is reached:

- The decision must be explicit
- The reason must be documented (scenario reference)
- The content lifecycle state remains **Observed** or is **Closed**
- No Drafted state is created

Silence is not a decision. Documentation is required.

---

## 6. Communication Principles

When communicating a no-content outcome:

- Be direct and calm
- Reference audit observation and governance
- Avoid framing as delay or failure
- Reinforce that restraint preserves authority

Example framing:
> “Based on the current audit signals, producing content now would add noise rather than authority. The correct action is to wait.”

---

## 7. Enforcement Rule

- No content may be created to satisfy cadence, pressure, or expectation
- Lifecycle rules must not be bypassed to force output
- Repeated pressure to override no-content decisions may trigger escalation review

Restraint is a governance requirement.

---

## 8. Relationship to Other Pillars

- P2 ensures readiness before expression
- P3 ensures observation before creation
- P4 enforces disciplined execution
- P5 preserves trust through honest continuity

No-content decisions reinforce all pillars simultaneously.

---

## 9. Lock Statement

This SOP is authoritative.

Any content created in violation of a no-content scenario violates P4 governance and must be corrected or removed.
