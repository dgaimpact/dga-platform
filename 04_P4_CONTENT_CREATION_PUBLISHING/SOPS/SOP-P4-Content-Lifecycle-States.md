## 1. Purpose

This SOP defines the **mandatory lifecycle states** through which all P4 content must pass.

Its purpose is to:
- prevent premature or speculative publishing
- preserve audit neutrality
- ensure traceability from observation to execution
- avoid content sprawl and decay
- enforce governance across content systems

Content does not exist by default.  
It progresses deliberately.

---

## 2. What This SOP Governs

This SOP governs:

- The lifecycle states of all content
- Allowed transitions between states
- Preconditions required for each state
- Prohibited shortcuts and bypasses

If a content item has no state, it is invalid.

---

## 3. What This SOP Does *Not* Govern

This SOP does **not** govern:

- Editorial voice or tone
- Writing style or length
- Channel-specific formatting
- Performance evaluation

This SOP governs **state**, not expression.

---

## 4. Canonical Content Lifecycle States

Every content item must exist in **one and only one** of the following states.

---

### 4.1 Observed

**Definition:**  
Content opportunity is identified based on audit artifacts.

**Entry Conditions:**  
- P3 audit artifacts exist  
- No interpretation or recommendation is made  

**Allowed Actions:**  
- Flagging
- Notation
- Cataloging  

**Prohibited Actions:**  
- Drafting
- Messaging
- Publishing

**Failure Mode Prevented:**  
Speculative or assumption-driven content

---

### 4.2 Drafted

**Definition:**  
Content has been created but not approved for release.

**Entry Conditions:**  
- Observed state completed  
- Draft content exists  

**Allowed Actions:**  
- Internal review
- Structural refinement
- Governance alignment  

**Prohibited Actions:**  
- Publishing
- Distribution
- Performance framing

**Failure Mode Prevented:**  
Premature execution

---

### 4.3 Approved

**Definition:**  
Content is validated for correctness and governance alignment.

**Entry Conditions:**  
- Draft reviewed against audit artifacts  
- No outcome guarantees or speculative claims  
- Compliance with P4 constraints  

**Allowed Actions:**  
- Scheduling
- Formatting
- Destination selection  

**Prohibited Actions:**  
- Editorial drift
- Post-hoc justification

**Failure Mode Prevented:**  
Governance breach

---

### 4.4 Published

**Definition:**  
Content is released to an approved destination.

**Entry Conditions:**  
- Approved state completed  
- Destination authorized  

**Allowed Actions:**  
- Distribution
- Referencing
- Relationship-based sharing  

**Prohibited Actions:**  
- Post-publication modification without reversion to Drafted

**Failure Mode Prevented:**  
Silent edits

---

### 4.5 Reinforced

**Definition:**  
Content is intentionally re-surfaced or referenced to support continuity.

**Entry Conditions:**  
- Published state completed  
- Human-intent reinforcement decision  

**Allowed Actions:**  
- Contextual sharing
- Relationship-based reuse  

**Prohibited Actions:**  
- Automated amplification without review

**Failure Mode Prevented:**  
Artificial engagement

---

### 4.6 Archived

**Definition:**  
Content is no longer active but retained for record or reference.

**Entry Conditions:**  
- Obsolescence identified  
- Superseding content exists or relevance has expired  

**Allowed Actions:**  
- Historical reference
- Audit trail preservation  

**Prohibited Actions:**  
- Re-publication without re-entry into Drafted

**Failure Mode Prevented:**  
Zombie content

---

## 5. State Transitions (Non-Negotiable)

Allowed transitions:

- Observed → Drafted  
- Drafted → Approved  
- Approved → Published  
- Published → Reinforced  
- Published → Archived  
- Reinforced → Archived  

All other transitions are prohibited.

---

## 6. Enforcement Rule

- Content may not skip states
- Content may not exist outside the lifecycle
- Any violation invalidates the content item

Governance overrides convenience.

---

## 7. Relationship to Other Pillars

- P3 defines *what is observed*
- P4 defines *what is expressed*
- P5 defines *how it is sustained*

Lifecycle discipline preserves this separation.

---

## 8. Lock Statement

This SOP is authoritative.

Any content created, published, or distributed outside these lifecycle states violates P4 governance and must be corrected.
