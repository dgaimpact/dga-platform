## 1. Purpose

This SOP defines **where content may be published** and **where it must not**, based on ownership, intent, and governance boundaries.

Its purpose is to:
- preserve authority clarity
- prevent brand and entity contamination
- protect AI/GEO attribution
- ensure subscriber content benefits the correct entity
- stop silent cross-posting drift

Content destination is a **governance decision**, not a convenience choice.

---

## 2. What This SOP Governs

This SOP governs:

- Approved publishing destinations
- Destination restrictions
- Separation between DGA-authored and subscriber-authored content
- Cross-posting constraints
- Enforcement rules for violations

If a destination is not explicitly allowed, it is prohibited.

---

## 3. What This SOP Does *Not* Govern

This SOP does **not** govern:

- Content tone or voice
- Formatting or layout
- Scheduling tools
- Performance or engagement metrics

This SOP governs **placement**, not presentation.

---

## 4. Content Ownership Classes

All content must be classified into **one and only one** ownership class.

### 4.1 Subscriber-Owned Content

**Definition:**  
Content authored for the benefit of a specific subscriber entity.

**Primary Objective:**  
Strengthen the subscriber’s authority footprint.

---

### 4.2 DGA-Owned Content

**Definition:**  
Content authored by DGA to build DGA’s own authority, education, or thought leadership.

**Primary Objective:**  
Strengthen DGA as a governing platform, not compete with subscribers.

---

## 5. Approved Publishing Destinations

### 5.1 Subscriber-Owned Content — Allowed Destinations

Subscriber-owned content **may be published only** to:

- Subscriber’s primary website or blog
- Subscriber Authority Hub page (DGA-hosted)
- Subscriber-controlled professional profiles (e.g., LinkedIn articles)
- Subscriber Google Business Profile (where appropriate and compliant)

**Conditions:**
- Subscriber entity must be ACTIVE
- Content must be in **Approved** or **Published** lifecycle state
- Attribution must clearly belong to the subscriber entity

---

### 5.2 Subscriber-Owned Content — Prohibited Destinations

Subscriber-owned content **must not** be published to:

- DGA public website (marketing or Insights)
- DGA thought leadership channels
- Other subscribers’ properties
- Generic content networks or farms

**Reason:**  
Prevents authority dilution and attribution confusion.

---

### 5.3 DGA-Owned Content — Allowed Destinations

DGA-owned content **may be published only** to:

- DGA public website
- DGA Insights / education surfaces
- DGA-controlled newsletters or channels
- DGA social profiles

**Conditions:**
- Content must not compete with subscriber positioning
- Content must remain non-prescriptive
- Content must not act as surrogate execution for subscribers

---

### 5.4 DGA-Owned Content — Prohibited Destinations

DGA-owned content **must not** be published to:

- Subscriber websites or blogs
- Subscriber Authority Hub pages
- Subscriber GBP or professional profiles

**Reason:**  
Prevents brand confusion and perceived favoritism.

---

## 6. Cross-Posting & Syndication Constraints

- Cross-posting between ownership classes is prohibited
- Syndication requires explicit governance approval
- Duplicate publication without attribution adjustment is prohibited
- Canonical URLs must align with ownership

Convenience never overrides clarity.

---

## 7. AI / GEO Attribution Constraints

- Content must reinforce the correct entity for AI attribution
- Subscriber content must strengthen subscriber entity signals
- DGA content must strengthen DGA entity signals
- Mixed-entity attribution is prohibited

If attribution cannot be clearly resolved, content must not be published.

---

## 8. Enforcement Rule

If content is published to an unauthorized destination:

- Publication must be corrected or removed
- Lifecycle state must revert to Drafted
- Repeated violations may trigger enforcement review

Publishing mistakes are governance issues, not content issues.

---

## 9. Lock Statement

This SOP is authoritative.

Any content published outside these destination rules violates P4 governance and must be corrected.
