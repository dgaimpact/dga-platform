## 1. Purpose of P4 — Content Creation & Publishing

P4 — Content Creation & Publishing governs **the creation, formatting, and controlled distribution of structured authority content** within DGA.

This pillar exists to:
- translate audit insight into structured, entity-aligned content
- support AI visibility and answer selection (GEO / AIO)
- ensure consistent authority signals across required platforms
- remove execution burden from subscribers

P4 executes **what is created and where it is published**,  
not *why* it is created and not *how relationships are managed*.

---

## 2. What This Pillar Owns

P4 owns all systems, documents, and logic related to:

- Long-form authority content creation
- Canonical publishing to the **DGA Authority Hub**
- Structured content formatting for AI consumption
- Managed omni-channel population of required platforms
- Content governance, consistency, and lifecycle tracking

P4 is responsible for **execution discipline**, not strategic interpretation.

---

## 3. What This Pillar Explicitly Does NOT Own

P4 does **not** own:

- Audit logic or interpretation (P3)
- Prospect qualification or intake (P1 / P2)
- Relationship outreach or human follow-up (P5)
- Performance guarantees or outcome attribution
- Subscriber-led publishing decisions

Content execution is **system-led**, not subscriber-driven.

### Subfolder Definitions

- **BLUEPRINTS/**  
  Define content philosophy, scope, and non-negotiable design constraints.

- **EXECUTION_DOCTRINES/**  
  Enforce deterministic rules for content creation, formatting, and publishing.

- **SYSTEMS/**  
  Logical designs supporting content generation and lifecycle management.

- **AUTOMATIONS/**  
  Workflow automation for publishing, population, and internal signaling.

- **CONTENT_LIBRARY/**  
  Canonical content assets, templates, and structured outputs.

- **ASSETS/**  
  Reference materials, examples, and non-executing support content.

---

## 5. Governing Constraints

- All content must originate from governed systems
- Publishing destinations are defined by execution doctrine, not preference
- Content must remain entity-aligned and audit-informed
- Subscribers do not control publishing mechanics
- Optional platforms may be supported, but core platforms are mandatory

Content consistency outranks customization.

---

## 6. Key Principle

> **P4 executes authority at scale.  
> Precision, structure, and consistency matter more than volume.**

The value of content is cumulative and governed.
