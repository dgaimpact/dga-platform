# P4 to P5 Boundary & Handoff

**Document Type:** Execution Doctrine (ED)  
**Pillar:** P4 — Content Creation & Publishing  
**Status:** Draft (Template-Conformant)  
**Applies To:** P4 ↔ P5 System Boundary  
**Owned By:** DGA Core Platform  

---

## 1. Purpose

This Execution Doctrine defines the **explicit boundary and handoff rules** between:

- **P4 — Content Creation & Publishing**
- **P5 — Relationship Continuity**

Its purpose is to:

- Prevent execution, continuity, or CRM logic from back-propagating into P4
- Preserve the Account Hub as a disclosure-only surface
- Ensure prepared amplification artifacts are not misinterpreted as engagement signals
- Lock architectural separation for long-term platform integrity

This doctrine governs **boundary behavior only**.  
It does not define P5 logic or workflows.

---

## 2. Scope

This doctrine applies to:

- All P4 outputs, disclosures, and prepared artifacts
- The Account Hub as a P4 disclosure surface
- Any P5 system that consumes or references P4 outputs

This doctrine does **not** apply to:

- Internal P5 execution logic
- CRM implementation details
- Subscriber communication strategies
- External email, SMS, or marketing platforms

---

## 3. Definitions

For the purposes of this doctrine:

- **P4 Output**  
  Any executed or prepared artifact produced under P4 governance (content, disclosure, reference copy).

- **Prepared Amplification Artifact**  
  Non-executed reference material (email copy, SMS samples, platform copy) surfaced for optional use.

- **Continuity Signal**  
  Any data interpreted as engagement, intent, follow-up, or relationship state.

---

## 4. Governing Principles (Non-Negotiable)

The following principles apply at the P4 ↔ P5 boundary:

- P4 produces **artifacts**, not signals
- P4 disclosure implies **no engagement**
- P4 outputs must not be interpreted as follow-up requirements
- P5 may consume P4 outputs **only as static inputs**
- Absence of P4 activity is not a continuity signal

Boundary clarity overrides convenience.

---

## 5. P4 Responsibilities (End State)

P4 responsibilities end when:

- Content is executed and published
- Disclosure is rendered in the Account Hub
- Prepared amplification artifacts are displayed as reference-only

At this point:

- P4 has no awareness of downstream use
- P4 does not observe engagement or response
- P4 does not track, infer, or react

P4 produces **visibility, not continuity**.

---

## 6. Permitted P5 Consumption

P5 systems may:

- Reference P4 content URLs
- Reference P4 publication dates
- Reference prepared amplification artifacts as static copy
- Associate P4 content with P5-defined workflows

All interpretation occurs **entirely within P5**.

---

## 7. Prohibited P5 Inference (Strict)

P5 systems must never infer from P4:

- Engagement or interest
- Responsiveness or intent
- Follow-up priority
- Relationship status
- Performance or effectiveness
- Subscriber behavior

P4 provides **no continuity signals** of any kind.

---

## 8. Email & SMS Boundary Clarification

Prepared Email and SMS artifacts:

- Are created under P4 governance
- Are disclosed in the Account Hub
- Are **not sent, tracked, or scheduled by P4**

P5 must treat these artifacts as:

- Optional static inputs
- Non-authoritative
- Non-binding
- Non-indicative of contact cadence

No implied obligation exists.

---

## 9. Account Hub Boundary Statement

The Account Hub:

- Is not a continuity dashboard
- Is not a CRM surface
- Is not a follow-up queue
- Is not a signal generator

Any P5 system must treat the Account Hub as **read-only disclosure**, not behavioral input.

---

## 10. Enforcement Rules

- Any P5 logic that consumes P4 outputs must comply with this boundary
- Any attempt to infer continuity from P4 constitutes a governance breach
- Boundary violations override implementation convenience
- Repeated violations require architectural review

---

## 11. Governance Alignment

This doctrine operates under and aligns with:

- ED-P4-Account-Hub-Disclosure-Index-&-Authority-Map  
- ED-P4-Account-Hub-Disclosure-Analytics-&-Telemetry-Exclusion  
- ED-P4-Account-Hub-Disclosure-Copy-&-Language-Standards  

It introduces no execution authority and no system of record.

---

## 12. Lock Statement

> P4 ends at disclosure.  
> P5 begins at interpretation.  
> No continuity, engagement, or follow-up signal may cross this boundary.
