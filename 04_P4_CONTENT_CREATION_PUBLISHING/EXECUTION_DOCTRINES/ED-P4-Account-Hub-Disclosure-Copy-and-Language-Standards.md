# Account Hub Disclosure Copy & Language Standards

**Document Type:** Execution Doctrine (ED)  
**Pillar:** P4 — Content Creation & Publishing  
**Status:** Draft (Template-Conformant)  
**Applies To:** Account Hub (Private Disclosure Surface)  
**Owned By:** DGA Core Platform  

---

## 1. Purpose

This Execution Doctrine defines the **copy, language, and semantic standards** governing all text rendered within the Account Hub.

Its purpose is to:

- Ensure language reinforces the Account Hub’s **disclosure-only role**
- Prevent semantic drift toward execution, obligation, or optimization
- Maintain consistency across SO, PB, and PB-Sub views
- Eliminate ambiguity caused by marketing or instructional phrasing

This doctrine governs **language and meaning**, not content strategy or persuasion.

---

## 2. Scope

This doctrine applies to:

- Section headings
- Labels and captions
- Descriptive text
- Guidance copy
- Inline explanations
- Reference artifact labeling

This doctrine does **not** apply to:

- Authority Hub editorial content
- Marketing websites (e.g., dgaimpact.com)
- Email or SMS copy prepared as reference artifacts
- Admin or internal tooling interfaces

---

## 3. Definitions

For the purposes of this doctrine:

- **Disclosure Language**  
  Neutral, descriptive language that explains what exists without implying action.

- **Directive Language**  
  Language that instructs, urges, or pressures the user to take action.

- **Performance Framing**  
  Language that implies effectiveness, results, success, or optimization.

---

## 4. Governing Principles (Non-Negotiable)

All Account Hub language must adhere to the following principles:

- Language must be **descriptive, not directive**
- Language must describe **state**, not **expectation**
- Language must avoid urgency, persuasion, or encouragement
- Language must not imply responsibility or next steps
- Clarity must override marketing tone

If a phrase can be interpreted as an instruction, it must be rewritten.

---

## 5. Permitted Language Patterns

The following language patterns are explicitly allowed:

### 5.1 Descriptive Status Language

- “Published on”
- “Scheduled for”
- “Available as reference”
- “Prepared copy”
- “Optional use”

---

### 5.2 Neutral Explanatory Language

- “This section displays…”
- “Shown here for visibility”
- “Provided for reference”
- “Grouped by niche”

---

### 5.3 Conditional and Non-Prescriptive Language

- “If applicable”
- “When enabled”
- “May be used externally”
- “Not executed by DGA”

---

## 6. Prohibited Language Patterns (Strict)

The following language patterns are **explicitly forbidden** in the Account Hub:

### 6.1 Directive or Instructional Language

- “You should”
- “Next step”
- “Send this”
- “Post now”
- “Take action”

---

### 6.2 Urgency or Pressure Language

- “Don’t miss”
- “Important”
- “Time-sensitive”
- “Act now”

---

### 6.3 Performance or Optimization Language

- “Best-performing”
- “High-converting”
- “Optimized”
- “Proven”
- “Increase results”

---

### 6.4 Responsibility-Implying Language

- “Required”
- “Outstanding”
- “Pending action”
- “Incomplete”

Any language that implies obligation violates this doctrine.

---

## 7. Labeling Standards

All labels must:

- Name **what something is**, not what to do with it
- Avoid verbs where possible
- Prefer nouns or neutral phrases

### Examples

**Allowed:**
- “Email Reference Copy”
- “SMS Sample Message”
- “Platform Allocation”
- “Scheduled Content”

**Disallowed:**
- “Send Email”
- “Share on Facebook”
- “Complete Posting”
- “Fix This”

---

## 8. Guidance Copy Constraints

Guidance text within the Account Hub must:

- Be optional in tone
- Be framed as context, not advice
- Avoid best-practice or coaching language
- Never escalate importance hierarchically

Guidance exists to **clarify meaning**, not to influence behavior.

---

## 9. Enforcement Rules

- Any copy violating this doctrine must be revised or removed
- No exceptions are permitted for clarity, marketing, or user preference
- Consistency across sections is mandatory
- Language drift constitutes a **governance breach**, not a copy edit

---

## 10. Governance Alignment

This doctrine operates under and aligns with:

- ED-P4-Account-Hub-Disclosure-Rendering  
- ED-P4-Account-Hub-Disclosure-UX-Boundaries  
- ED-P4-Account-Hub-Disclosure-Data-Contract  

It introduces no execution authority and no system of record.

---

## 11. Lock Statement

> All Account Hub language must describe state without implying action, urgency, or performance.  
> If language suggests responsibility or next steps, it violates this doctrine.
