# Account Hub Disclosure Analytics & Telemetry Exclusion

**Document Type:** Execution Doctrine (ED)  
**Pillar:** P4 — Content Creation & Publishing  
**Status:** Draft (Template-Conformant)  
**Applies To:** Account Hub (Private Disclosure Surface)  
**Owned By:** DGA Core Platform  

---

## 1. Purpose

This Execution Doctrine defines the **explicit exclusion of analytics, telemetry, and behavioral tracking** from the Account Hub.

Its purpose is to:

- Preserve the Account Hub as a **pure disclosure surface**
- Prevent interpretation of activity as performance
- Eliminate feedback loops that could influence allocation or execution
- Avoid privacy, compliance, and expectation risks

This doctrine governs **what must not be measured, tracked, or inferred** within the Account Hub.

---

## 2. Scope

This doctrine applies to:

- All Account Hub pages and routes
- All SO, PB, and PB-Sub account contexts
- All client-side and server-side instrumentation related to the Account Hub

This doctrine does **not** apply to:

- Authority Hub (public analytics may exist there)
- Marketing websites
- Admin consoles or internal monitoring
- Platform execution systems
- Infrastructure-level security logging

---

## 3. Definitions

For the purposes of this doctrine:

- **Analytics**  
  Any collection or display of usage, engagement, or performance metrics.

- **Telemetry**  
  Behavioral or event data generated by user interaction with the Account Hub.

- **Instrumentation**  
  Code or services used to observe, log, or analyze user behavior.

---

## 4. Governing Principles (Non-Negotiable)

All Account Hub behavior must adhere to the following:

- Disclosure does **not** require measurement
- Visibility must not influence future behavior
- No signal generated in the Account Hub may affect:
  - allocation
  - cadence
  - execution
- Absence of analytics is intentional, not a limitation

---

## 5. Explicitly Excluded Analytics & Telemetry

The Account Hub must never collect, compute, render, or infer:

- Page views
- Click counts
- Scroll depth
- Time on page
- Interaction events
- Session duration
- Heatmaps
- Conversion proxies
- Engagement indicators

No client-side or server-side substitutes are permitted.

---

## 6. Prohibited Instrumentation

The following are **explicitly forbidden** on Account Hub surfaces:

- Google Analytics (any version)
- Tag managers
- Session replay tools
- A/B testing frameworks
- Event trackers
- Custom behavioral logging

No third-party or internal analytics tools may be attached.

---

## 7. Allowed Operational Logging (Strictly Limited)

The following **may** exist outside the Account Hub surface:

- Infrastructure logs required for uptime and security
- Error logging unrelated to user behavior
- Access control validation logs

These logs must:

- Never be surfaced to account holders
- Never be used for optimization or ranking
- Never influence allocation or cadence logic

---

## 8. UX & Copy Implications

Because analytics are excluded:

- No performance language may appear
- No “most viewed” or “popular” indicators may exist
- No success or failure framing is allowed
- No “engagement-based” sorting is permitted

All ordering must remain deterministic and rule-based.

---

## 9. Enforcement Rules

- Any analytics presence constitutes a **governance breach**
- Instrumentation must be removed immediately if detected
- No feature request may justify analytics inclusion
- Compliance overrides product convenience

---

## 10. Governance Alignment

This doctrine operates under and aligns with:

- ED-P4-Account-Hub-Disclosure-Rendering  
- ED-P4-Account-Hub-Disclosure-Data-Contract  
- ED-P4-Account-Hub-Disclosure-UX-Boundaries  
- ED-P4-Account-Hub-Disclosure-Copy-&-Language-Standards  
- ED-P4-Account-Hub-Disclosure-Security-&-Access-Governance  

It introduces no execution authority and no system of record.

---

## 11. Lock Statement

> The Account Hub must operate without analytics or telemetry.  
> Any measurement of user behavior within the Account Hub violates this doctrine.
