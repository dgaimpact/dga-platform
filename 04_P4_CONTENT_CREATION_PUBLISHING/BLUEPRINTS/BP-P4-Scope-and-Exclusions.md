# Scope & Exclusions

P4 — Content Creation & Publishing  
Canonical Scope and Exclusions

Version: v1.0  
Created: 2026-01-16  
Status: Governing Authority (Active)  
Primary Pillar: P4 — Content Creation & Publishing  
Consumed By: ED–P4–CORE, REG–P4–ArtifactCategories

---

## 1. Purpose & Authority

This document defines the **full scope of P4 responsibilities** and enumerates **explicit exclusions** for content generation.  

It exists to:
- Protect audit → content causality
- Ensure all artifacts are traceable, declarative, and governed
- Prevent drift, speculation, or platform chasing
- Provide a single authoritative reference for ED enforcement and system operations

---

## 2. P4 Scope

P4 governs the **creation, formatting, and canonical publishing** of artifacts derived from **Top-3 GEO pressure points** from the most recent P3 audit.

**Key points:**
- One artifact per pressure point, per audit cycle  
- Canonical entity declaration always first, immutable within the cycle  
- VBP applied only to subordinate narrative  
- Traceability metadata attached to all artifacts  
- Execution strictly within the **approved 30-day cycle**  
- Publishing only to **mandatory + optional platforms** approved at P2 onboarding

## 3. P4 Explicit Exclusions

P4 is **prohibited from**:

1. Generating content for **unauthorized or unapproved platforms**  
2. Publishing outside the **current audit cycle**  
3. Modifying, refreshing, or evergreening previously published artifacts  
4. Blending multiple GEO pressure points into a single artifact  
5. Introducing new entity facts not verified in P2/P3 inputs  
6. Generating persuasive, sales, CTA, or marketing language  
7. Referencing competitors, rankings, or relative comparisons  
8. Referencing AI behavior, audits, or optimization intent  
9. Including temporal or freshness claims unless explicitly validated  
10. Using IIP, prior content, or subscriber input for voice or style  
11. Varying artifact length, depth, cadence, or splitting/merging except where category explicitly requires  
12. Reusing or repackaging prior artifacts from previous cycles  
13. Proactively generating content without P3 trigger  
14. Generating artifacts for non-actionable pressure points  
15. Optimizing based on engagement or performance signals  

---

## 4. Governance Rules

- ED–P4–CORE enforces all scope and exclusions  
- REG–P4–ArtifactCategories defines the fixed artifact category set  
- Any artifact outside scope or violating exclusions is **invalid**  
- All exceptions or new categories must undergo **formal governance review**  

---

## 5. Key Principle

> **P4 executes content with precision, traceability, and audit alignment.**  
> Artifacts are declarative, single-purpose, and fully governed.  
> No artifact may exist outside the defined scope or exclusions.  

---

## 6. Change Control

- Changes require:  
  - Version increment  
  - Documented rationale  
  - Blueprint and ED compatibility review  
  - Explicit approval by DGA governance team  
- No silent updates permitted
