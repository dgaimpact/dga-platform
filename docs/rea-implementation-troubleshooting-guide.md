## Overview

This guide helps Mortgage Professionals identify and resolve common REA implementation failures. Early detection and intervention can save partnerships and protect your marketing investment.

## Common Implementation Failures & Solutions

### Problem 1: Content Not Being Posted

**Symptoms:**
- No social media posts from provided content
- GBP posts not appearing
- Email newsletters not sent

**Immediate Actions:**
1. **Check Understanding:** "Hey [REA Name], I noticed we haven't seen any posts go live this week. Is there any part of the process that's unclear?"
2. **Simplify Process:** Offer to walk through posting on one platform together
3. **Provide Tools:** Share scheduling tool recommendations (Hootsuite, Buffer, etc.)
4. **Adjust Tier:** Consider moving to lower tier if time is the issue

**Script for Conversation:**
"I've invested in creating content specifically for your business, but I'm not seeing it implemented. This content is designed to drive visibility and leads to you. Can we problem-solve together to make this work?"

### Problem 2: Poor Quality Posting

**Symptoms:**
- Posts with broken links
- Incorrect formatting
- Wrong images or no images
- Posting at random times

**Immediate Actions:**
1. **Provide Clear Examples:** Share screenshots of ideal posts
2. **Create Cheat Sheets:** One-page guides for each platform
3. **Schedule Training:** 15-minute screen share to demonstrate posting
4. **Assign Point Person:** If REA has staff, train the right person

**Script for Conversation:**
"I want to make sure you're getting the maximum benefit from our content. I noticed a few posts had some issues that might reduce their effectiveness. Let me show you how to fix these quickly."

### Problem 3: No Cross-Promotion

**Symptoms:**
- MP not tagged in social posts
- No links to MP article
- No mention of partnership

**Immediate Actions:**
1. **Remind of Agreement:** Gently remind REA of partnership expectations
2. **Provide Easy Templates:** Pre-written posts with tags and links included
3. **Highlight Mutual Benefit:** Explain how cross-promotion helps both parties
4. **Make It Easy:** Provide direct links and tagging instructions

**Script for Conversation:**
"Our partnership is designed to be a two-way street. When you cross-promote my services, it helps your clients get better mortgage advice and reinforces our collaborative approach. Can we make sure we're both highlighting each other?"

### Problem 4: Inconsistent Implementation

**Symptoms:**
- Good weeks and bad weeks
- Sporadic posting
- Starts strong then fades

**Immediate Actions:**
1. **Identify Pattern:** Track when drops occur (end of month, busy seasons)
2. **Adjust Schedule:** Move to less frequent but consistent posting
3. **Batch Content:** Help them schedule a month in one sitting
4. **Set Reminders:** Offer to send implementation reminders

**Script for Conversation:**
"I've noticed your implementation has been inconsistent. Consistency is more important than frequency for building visibility. Would it help if we adjusted your tier or scheduling approach?"

### Problem 5: No Lead Referrals

**Symptoms:**
- Content generating engagement but no referrals
- REA not mentioning mortgage partnership to clients
- Leads going to other mortgage professionals

**Immediate Actions:**
1. **Track Content Performance:** Show REA the engagement metrics
2. **Provide Conversation Scripts:** How to naturally refer clients
3. **Joint Client Meetings:** Offer to co-host buyer seminars
4. **Revisit Value Proposition:** Remind REA of your unique benefits

**Script for Conversation:**
"I'm seeing great engagement with your content, but I'm not receiving the referred leads we discussed. Is there a disconnect in how we're handling the handoff? Let's make sure we're both clear on the process."

## Escalation Framework

### Stage 1: Gentle Reminder (Week 1-2 of issue)
- Casual check-in via email or text
- Offer assistance and training
- Assume good intentions

### Stage 2: Direct Conversation (Week 3-4 of issue)
- Scheduled call to address concerns
- Clear data showing the issue
- Specific requests for improvement

### Stage 3: Performance Improvement Plan (Month 2)
- 30-day timeline for improvement
- Clear metrics for success
- Consequences outlined (partnership termination)

### Stage 4: Partnership Termination (Month 3)
- Formal termination notice
- 30-day wind down of content
- Professional closure

## Prevention Strategies

### During Onboarding
- **Set Clear Expectations:** Use the partnership agreement
- **Assess Technical Comfort:** During onboarding call
- **Provide Adequate Training:** Don't assume knowledge
- **Start Simple:** Begin with easiest platforms first

### Ongoing Maintenance
- **Regular Check-ins:** Weekly for first month, then monthly
- **Performance Dashboards:** Share visibility metrics
- **Success Celebrations:** Highlight wins and improvements
- **Continuous Education:** Share new features and best practices

## Tools & Resources

### Implementation Aids
- **Scheduling Tools:** Hootsuite, Buffer, Later
- **Graphic Tools:** Canva templates for each platform
- **Checklists:** Weekly posting checklists
- **Video Tutorials:** Short how-to videos for each platform

### Monitoring Tools

- **GBP Post Tracking:** Manual checks or BrightLocal
- **Website Analytics:** Google Analytics for article traffic
- **Lead Tracking:** CRM integration for referral sources

## Success Stories

### Case Study: From Struggling to Successful
**Problem:** REA with great content but inconsistent posting
**Solution:** Moved to Medium tier, implemented batching, provided scheduling tool
**Result:** 3x more consistent posting, 5 leads in first month of consistency

### Case Study: Cross-Promotion Breakthrough
**Problem:** REA not cross-promoting MP services
**Solution:** Created pre-written posts with tags, scheduled joint client event
**Result:** 8 referred leads in one month, stronger partnership

## When to Cut Losses

### Red Flags
- Repeated broken promises
- Unresponsive to multiple contact attempts
- Consistently low implementation scores
- No referral flow after 90 days with good content engagement

### Exit Script
"After [timeframe] of working together, it's clear this partnership isn't delivering the mutual value we both need. I'll be winding down your content delivery over the next 30 days. I wish you the best in your business."
