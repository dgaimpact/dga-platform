## Onboarding Call Script

### Opening (2 minutes)
"Thanks for making time. Now that we're moving forward, I want to make sure our content plan perfectly matches your actual business focus. The audit I showed was based on [assumed niche], but I want to confirm exactly how you want to position yourself."

### Niche Validation (10 minutes)

**Key Questions:**
1. "In your own words, what's the specific niche or specialty you want to dominate in search results?"
2. "What type of clients do you most enjoy working with?"
3. "Are there any specific neighborhoods or property types you focus on?"
4. "How do you currently describe your specialty to potential clients?"

**Transition Statement:**
"Perfect - that's much clearer than my initial assumption. Now let me capture the specific details we need to build your content plan."

## Handling Significant Changes

### Scenario: Major Niche Shift
**If REA wants completely different niche than pitched:**
1. "I understand you're actually focused on [new niche]. Let me update our approach immediately."
2. "This might require a quick re-audit to ensure we're targeting the right keywords."
3. "The content timeline might shift by 1-2 days while we adjust."

### Scenario: Multiple Niches
**If REA wants to cover multiple specialties:**
1. "We typically see best results focusing on one primary niche initially."
2. "Let's start with your strongest niche for the first 90 days, then evaluate adding others."
3. "Trying to dominate multiple niches simultaneously can dilute our effectiveness."

### Scenario: Unrealistic Expectations
**If REA expects instant results:**
1. "This is a momentum-building strategy, not an overnight solution."
2. "We typically see visibility improvements within 30-60 days with consistent implementation."
3. "The key is sticking with the plan even when immediate results aren't visible."
