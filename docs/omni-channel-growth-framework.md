## Overview

The Omni-Channel Growth Framework (OCGF) is DGA's proprietary content strategy that synchronizes Mortgage Professional and Real Estate Agent content to maximize GEO/AIO visibility through strategic cross-promotion and tiered content volume options.

## Core Components

### 1. Foundation Articles
- **3,000+ word pillar content** for both MP and REA partners
- **Niche-focused** addressing specific market segments
- **Cross-linked** with partner articles for authority building
- **Schema-optimized** with proper markup from day one
- **Credible sourcing** with links to authoritative sources (CMHC, CREA, StatsCan)

### 2. Tiered Content Volumes
Three subscription levels determine content frequency and channel coverage:

| Tier | Foundation Articles | Supporting Content | Ideal For |
|------|---------------------|-------------------|-----------|
| **High** | 4 articles/month | Daily social, weekly emails, regular GBP posts | Established businesses with dedicated marketing resources |
| **Medium** | 2 articles/month | 3x weekly social, bi-weekly emails, weekly GBP | Growing businesses with limited marketing time |
| **Low** | 1 article/month | 1x weekly social, monthly emails, bi-weekly GBP | New businesses or seasonal focus periods |

### 3. Synchronized Publishing
- MP and REA articles published **simultaneously**
- **Cross-referenced hyperlinks** between partner articles
- **Coordinated social amplification** across channels
- **Unified messaging** around shared niche/market focus

## MP-REA Coordination Process

### For MP Playbook Subscribers

**Content Triggering:**
```
REA Content Plan Generated 
    ↓
MP Corresponding Content Plan Automatically Created
    ↓
Both Parties Receive Simultaneous Delivery
    ↓
Coordinated Publication According to Calendar
```

**Multi-REA Management:**
- Each active REA partner generates separate MP content
- MP must manage multiple content calendars
- Cross-promotion happens with each REA individually
- MP visibility compounds across multiple niches

### For Solo Subscribers
- Receive standalone content plan for their niche
- No cross-promotion requirements
- Same content quality and volume options
- Focused on individual authority building

## Implementation Best Practices

### Publication Timing
- **Publish foundation articles simultaneously** with partner
- **Schedule supporting content** according to tier frequency
- **Stagger social posts** across platforms for sustained visibility
- **Maintain consistent posting** according to selected tier

### Cross-Promotion Excellence
- **Verify hyperlinks** before publication
- **Use natural anchor text** (not "click here")
- **Coordinate social mentions** when possible
- **Share each other's content** on social channels

### GEO/AIO Optimization
- **Implement all provided schema markup**
- **Follow platform-specific best practices**
- **Maintain NAP consistency** across all channels
- **Update profiles regularly** with fresh content

## Success Metrics

### Tier-Specific Goals
| Tier | Target Outcomes |
|------|----------------|
| **High** | Dominant niche visibility, multiple AI answer appearances |
| **Medium** | Strong local presence, consistent AI recommendations |
| **Low** | Foundational visibility, gradual authority building |

### Key Performance Indicators

- Cross-link click-through rates
- Local search ranking improvements
- AI answer/snippet appearances
- Client acquisition through content

## Common Scenarios & Solutions

### Publication Conflicts
**Problem:** Partner cannot publish simultaneously  
**Solution:** Publish within 24-hour window and update links if needed

### Multiple REA Partners
**Problem:** MP has content for multiple REAs in same period  
**Solution:** Stagger publication by a few days each, maintain individual focus

### Tier Changes
