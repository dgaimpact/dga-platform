## Sales Process Framework

### Phase 1: Prospecting & Lead Generation

**Channels:**

- **Referral Program:** Existing subscriber referrals
- **Content Marketing:** GEO/AIO educational content that demonstrates expertise

**Lead Qualification Criteria:**

### Phase 2: Discovery & Needs Assessment

**Discovery Call Script - MP Playbook:**
```
"Thanks for your interest in DGA. I understand you're looking to [grow your REA network/improve referral consistency]. Tell me about your current REA partnerships and what's working or not working with your current approach."
```

**Key Discovery Questions:**
- How many REA partners do you currently work with?
- What's your current process for staying top-of-mind with them?
- How much time do you spend on marketing and content creation?
- What would consistent, qualified referrals mean for your business?

**Discovery Call Script - REA Solo:**
```
"I see you specialize in [their niche]. Tell me about your current online visibility - when people search for [niche] in [market], how easily do they find you?"
```

**Key Discovery Questions:**
- What percentage of your business comes from online visibility?
- How much time do you spend on content creation monthly?
- What's your biggest frustration with current marketing efforts?
- What would dominating your niche in search mean for your business?

### Phase 3: Solution Demonstration

**Demo Structure - MP Playbook:**
1. **Territory & Niche Analysis:** Show available territories and niche opportunities
2. **Content System Demo:** Show sample content calendars and cross-promotion examples
3. **REA Onboarding Process:** Walk through the partnership framework
4. **Performance Tracking:** Demonstrate reporting and ROI measurement

**Demo Structure - REA Solo:**
1. **GEO/AIO Audit:** Show current visibility gaps and opportunities
2. **Content Samples:** Demonstrate niche-specific content quality
3. **Implementation Simplicity:** Show how easy it is to use provided content
4. **Results Timeline:** Set realistic expectations for visibility improvement

### Phase 4: Proposal & Closing

**Value Proposition - MP Playbook:**
```
"For [price]/month, you get:
- Exclusive territory rights in [territory]  
- Done-for-you content for you and your REA partners
- Systematic REA partnership framework
- GEO/AIO visibility improvement tracking
- All the tools to build a predictable referral engine"
```

**Value Proposition - REA Solo:**
```
"For [price]/month, you get:
- Exclusive niche protection in [territory]
- Done-for-you content tailored to your specialty
- GEO/AIO optimization for your specific market
- Simple implementation process
- The ability to dominate your niche in local search"
```

**Handling Common Objections:**

**"It's too expensive."**
- "What's the cost of one additional referral per month? This system is designed to pay for itself with your first new client."
- "Compared to hiring a marketing agency or spending your own time, this is actually more cost-effective and specialized."

**"I don't have time to implement."**
- "That's exactly why we built this - we do the heavy lifting. Implementation takes most subscribers 30-60 minutes per week."
- "The time you save on content creation alone typically justifies the investment."

**"I need to think about it."**
- "What specific information would help you make a decision? I can provide case studies or connect you with current subscribers."
- "The territory and niche you're interested in may not be available if you wait too long."
