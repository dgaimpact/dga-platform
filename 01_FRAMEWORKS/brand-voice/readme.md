# Brand Voice System  
### Strategic Framework + Operational Workflow for Client Voice Consistency

---

## Purpose

The **Brand Voice System** is the authoritative framework for capturing, documenting, and operationalizing a client’s authentic voice across the entire DGA ecosystem.

It ensures:

- Consistent tone, style, and messaging across all channels  
- Accurate client representation in all AI-generated and human-written content  
- Stronger entity and GEO/AI signals  
- Seamless alignment with OCGF, audits, onboarding, and engagement systems  
- Repeatable workflows for every MP or REA subscriber  

This folder contains everything required to execute the Brand Voice System from interview → blueprint → implementation.

---

## Folder Contents

### **1. `framework.md`**  
Defines the full Brand Voice Framework — purpose, architecture, components, data structure, and how it integrates with DGA systems (OCGF, audits, CRM, content engine).

### **2. `interview-script.md`**  
The structured onboarding script used to extract a client’s natural language patterns, tone, preferences, and communication behavior.

### **3. `blueprint-template.md`**  
The standardized template used to create a formal **Brand Voice Blueprint (BVB)** for each client.

### **4. `ai-wrapper.md`**  
A reusable AI system prompt that ensures all outputs generated by ChatGPT or DGA automations strictly follow the client’s Brand Voice Blueprint.

### **5. `notion-implementation.md`**  
Documentation on how the Brand Voice System is stored, surfaced, and used inside the DGA Notion workspace, including CRM integration and content workflows.

## Usage Workflow

1. **Conduct the Brand Voice Interview**  
   → Use `interview-script.md`

2. **Produce the Brand Voice Blueprint (BVB)**  
   → Use `blueprint-template.md`

3. **Store & Link in Notion**  
   → Follow `notion-implementation.md`

4. **Use BVB for All Content Creation**  
   → Apply `ai-wrapper.md` in ChatGPT, workflows, and automations

5. **Reference the Framework as Needed**  
   → For upgrades, alignment, and system-wide consistency

This workflow is standardized across all DGA client engagements.
