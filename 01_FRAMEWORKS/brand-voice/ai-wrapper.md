# Brand Voice AI Wrapper Prompt  
*A reusable system prompt ensuring all AI-generated content reflects the client’s Brand Voice Blueprint (BVB).*

## Purpose
This wrapper ensures all content produced through ChatGPT, n8n automations, or DGA systems strictly follows the client's Brand Voice Blueprint.  
It acts as a “voice guardrail” to maintain tone consistency across every channel and asset.

Use this wrapper whenever generating:

- Foundation articles  
- Social content  
- Market updates  
- Scripts  
- Email newsletters  
- REA-facing content  
- Consumer-facing content  
- Any derived content in the OCGF pipeline
