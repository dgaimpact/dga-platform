# 01_FRAMEWORKS  
### Strategic Systems That Power the DGA Ecosystem

---

## Purpose

The **01_FRAMEWORKS** directory contains all high-level strategic frameworks that define *how DGA works at a conceptual and operational level*.  
These frameworks guide every downstream system, workflow, automation, and prompt.

If **00_FOUNDATIONS** defines what DGA *is*, then **01_FRAMEWORKS** defines how DGA *operates* at a strategic and structural level.

---

## Scope

This folder includes the major frameworks that shape:

- Brand identity and voice  
- Omni-channel content strategy  
- GEO/AI visibility methodology  
- Persona and niche architecture  
- MP–REA engagement and relationship systems  
- Entity development and narrative models  

Frameworks in this folder **inform** every other part of the platform, including:

- Systems architecture (03_SYSTEMS)  
- Workflows and SOPs (02_OPERATIONS / 04_AUTOMATIONS)  
- Prompt structures and dependencies (08_STACKAI_PROMPT_LIBRARY)  
- Sales/marketing systems (07_SALES_MARKETING)

---

## Current & Expected Contents

Examples of files stored here:

### **Brand Voice Framework**
Defines how DGA extracts, structures, and operationalizes a client’s brand voice.

### **Omni-Channel Growth Framework (OCGF)**
The 15-component system that governs all content distribution, repurposing, and amplification.

### **GEO/AI Visibility Framework**
Entity-driven digital visibility architecture used for audits, content alignment, and AI-search optimization.

### **MP–REA Engagement Framework**
Relationship and ecosystem architecture for working with Mortgage Professionals and Real Estate Agents.

### **Persona & Niche Architecture**
High-level conceptual structures that connect persona work, niches, and content strategy.

Additional documents may include:

- `entity-development-framework.md`  
- `messaging-pyramid.md`  
- `narrative-framework.md`  
- `topic-cluster-model.md`  
- `frameworks-overview.md`

## How Frameworks Support the DGA Platform

Frameworks serve as the **strategic layer** that everything else builds on:

- **02_OPERATIONS** uses the frameworks to run onboarding, interviews, and delivery.  
- **03_SYSTEMS** codifies the frameworks into Notion, JSON structures, data schemas, and platform logic.  
- **04_AUTOMATIONS** automates steps that follow framework rules.  
- **05_AUDIT_TOOLS** uses frameworks as criteria for assessments and audits.  
- **06_CONTENT_SYSTEM** transforms frameworks into reusable content engines.  
- **07_SALES_MARKETING** applies frameworks to client acquisition, presentations, and positioning.  
- **08_STACKAI_PROMPT_LIBRARY** references frameworks to ensure prompt outputs stay consistent.

## When to Add or Update a Framework

You should create or modify files here when you:

- Introduce a new high-level model or conceptual system.  
- Update the logic behind narrative, messaging, or OCGF elements.  
- Add new relationship or engagement frameworks.  
- Expand entity-based or GEO/AI methodologies.  
- Create visual or structural architecture diagrams that represent DGA systems.

If a change is tactical or operational, it belongs in 02_OPERATIONS or 03_SYSTEMS instead.

---

## Editing Guidelines

- Write frameworks at a **strategic, system-wide level** — not execution detail.  
- Use clear conceptual diagrams, lists, and examples when helpful.  
- Avoid tool-specific or workflow-specific instructions.  
- Treat frameworks as **stable**, versioned assets — updates should be intentional.

---

## Status

This folder is **active**, foundational, and expected to expand as DGA evolves.  
Add new frameworks here before creating systems or workflows that rely on them.
