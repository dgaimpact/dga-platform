## 1. Purpose of P3 — Audit

P3 — Audit governs **observation, evaluation, and visibility-state determination** within DGA.

This pillar exists to:
- establish objective visibility and recommendability snapshots
- detect ecosystem changes without bias
- provide factual inputs to downstream systems
- prevent assumption-driven execution

Audit is **observational**, not corrective.  
Audit **informs** action but never **performs** action.

---

## 2. What This Pillar Owns

P3 owns all systems, documents, and logic related to:

- Snapshot audits (Day 00, scheduled intervals)
- Internal ecosystem monitoring
- Adhoc diagnostic audits
- Visibility and recommendability evaluation
- GEO and AIO signal observation
- Audit lifecycle state management

P3 defines **what is happening**, not what should be done about it.

---

## 3. What This Pillar Explicitly Does NOT Own

P3 does **not** own:

- Content creation or publishing decisions (P4)
- Prospect qualification or intake logic (P1 / P2)
- Relationship outreach or follow-up (P5)
- Performance enforcement or guarantees
- Predictive outcomes or promises

If an action is required, ownership transfers to the appropriate pillar.

### Subfolder Definitions

- **BLUEPRINTS/**  
  Define audit philosophy, scope, and non-negotiable design constraints.

- **EXECUTION_DOCTRINES/**  
  Enforce deterministic audit behavior, lifecycle rules, and execution boundaries.

- **SYSTEMS/**  
  Logical designs for audit orchestration, scoring, and persistence.

- **AUTOMATIONS/**  
  Workflow automation supporting audit execution and internal signaling.

- **TOOLS/**  
  Audit-specific instruments, evaluators, and diagnostic utilities.

- **ASSETS/**  
  Reference materials, audit explanations, and non-executing support content.

---

## 5. Governing Constraints

- Every audit must declare an execution mode
- Audits are point-in-time and immutable once completed
- Audits must not infer intent or outcomes
- Audit results may inform content planning but must not trigger action directly
- Adhoc audits are diagnostic only and never content-triggering

Audit integrity outranks convenience.

---

## 6. Key Principle

> **P3 tells the truth about the system.  
> It does not try to improve the truth.**

Accuracy, discipline, and restraint are the primary responsibilities of the Audit pillar.
