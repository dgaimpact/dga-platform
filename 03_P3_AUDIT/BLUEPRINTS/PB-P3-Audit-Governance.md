## FOUNDER DOCTRINE

P3 exists to establish **truth before action**.

The Audit pillar is designed to observe, measure, and surface visibility pressure points without bias, prescription, or execution bleed.  
Its role is not to improve outcomes, guide tactics, or promise change — but to define *what is happening* with discipline and consistency.

If P3 becomes flexible, adaptive, or instructional, the integrity of every downstream pillar collapses.

Audit must remain:
- deterministic
- repeatable
- comparable over time
- insulated from execution pressure

This blueprint exists to prevent audit drift, interpretation creep, and outcome-based framing as the AI environment evolves.

---

## 1. Purpose & Authority

This Blueprint defines the **authoritative governance rules** for how all P3 audits are constructed, executed, scored, presented, versioned, and constrained.

It establishes:
- audit invariants
- execution boundaries
- scoring philosophy
- presentation discipline
- P3 ↔ P4 separation rules

If any Execution Doctrine, system behavior, SOP, or AI agent output conflicts with this Blueprint, **this Blueprint prevails**.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

Without strict governance, audits tend to:
- adapt to incomplete data
- blend observation with advice
- expose internal mechanics
- drift in structure over time
- become benchmarks or promises

In AI-driven environments, this leads to:
- false confidence
- misinterpreted scores
- pressure to “optimize” AI behavior
- erosion of trust

This Blueprint solves for those risks by enforcing a **locked, observational audit protocol**.

---

## 3. Scope — What This Blueprint Governs

This Blueprint governs:
- audit eligibility rules
- deterministic execution requirements
- GEO and AIO audit structure
- scoring aggregation rules
- penalty application
- delta handling
- competitor handling
- tone and language constraints
- evidence usage
- immutability and versioning
- audit visibility rules
- lock and change control

---

## 4. Explicit Exclusions — What This Blueprint Does NOT Govern

This Blueprint does **not** govern:
- content creation or publishing (P4)
- execution artifacts or copy generation
- subscriber guidance or instructions
- platform optimization tactics
- audit scheduling mechanics
- dashboards, email framing, or delivery UX
- P5 relationship actions

Audit outputs must never instruct, execute, or imply downstream actions.

---

## 5. Core Definitions

- **Audit:** A point-in-time, immutable observation of AI visibility and recommendability signals.
- **GEO:** Governed Entity Optimization — clarity and consistency of controllable entity surfaces.
- **AIO:** AI Output Observation — how AI systems describe or surface the entity.
- **Top 3 Opportunities:** The highest-impact GEO pressure points identified in a cycle.
- **Ad-Hoc Audit:** An internal, diagnostic audit not visible to the account holder.
- **Audit Version:** Internal identifier representing the logic framework used for evaluation.

---

## 6. Foundational Principles

1. **Audit Must Precede Action**  
   No execution exists without prior observation.

2. **Determinism Over Adaptation**  
   Every audit runs the same sections, every time.

3. **GEO Leads, AIO Confirms**  
   GEO is causal. AIO is downstream expression.

4. **Opacity of Mechanics**  
   Scores are shown; how they are calculated is not.

5. **Comparability Over Time**  
   Structure stability outranks short-term accuracy tweaks.

---

## 7. Invariants & Non-Negotiables

- All audit sections always execute
- No adaptive skipping or conditional structure
- Penalties apply only at the item/factor level
- GEO and AIO are scored and displayed separately
- No blended or combined score
- No numeric success targets
- No urgency or time-based language
- No execution guidance
- No platform optimization claims
- Audits are immutable once generated

---

## 8. Pillar Ownership & Responsibilities

**P3 owns:**
- audit truth
- audit structure
- audit scoring logic
- audit presentation rules
- audit versioning
- audit governance

**P3 does not own:**
- remediation
- copy
- publishing
- distribution
- subscriber action

---

## 9. Relationships to Other Pillars

- **P2 → P3:** P2 establishes a clean entity baseline; P3 observes it.
- **P3 → P4:** P3 identifies pressure points; P4 consumes them silently.
- **P3 ↔ P5:** No direct interaction; relationship continuity never influences audit outcomes.

Audit findings must never be altered or softened to accommodate execution, content, or relationships.

---

## 10. Downstream Enforcement & Consumption Rules

- P4 may consume **Top 3 GEO categories only**
- P4 must not reference audit language verbatim
- P4 must not surface audit scores or findings publicly
- No downstream system may modify an audit once written
- Ad-hoc audits must never trigger P4

---

## 11. Versioning & Change Rules

- Audit logic may evolve under governance
- All logic changes increment the internal audit version
- Audit version is displayed in the report footer
- When changes affect comparability, a brief annotation is included
- No historical audits are regenerated

---

## 12. Compliance & Auditability

Compliance is validated by:
- structural consistency across audits
- unchanged section ordering
- invariant scoring presentation
- presence of required disclaimers
- correct application of version identifiers

Any violation requires regeneration, not patching.

---

## 13. Lock Statement

> This Blueprint is authoritative and binding.  
> The P3 Audit Protocol defined herein is **LOCKED**.  
> Any modification requires a formal governance revision, version increment, and downstream impact review.
