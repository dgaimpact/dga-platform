## FOUNDER DOCTRINE

Audit must lead. Content must follow.

The moment content is allowed to influence audit, DGA loses credibility, defensibility, and governance integrity. P3 establishes truth. P4 responds to truth. This directionality is irreversible.

Failure occurs when:

* content priorities bleed backward into audit logic
* audits are tuned to justify publishing decisions
* observation becomes advisory

P3 → P4 is a one-way boundary.

## 1. Purpose & Authority

This Blueprint governs the **handoff boundary between P3 (Audit) and P4 (Content Creation & Publishing)**.

It defines what P3 is permitted to emit, what P4 is permitted to consume, and what is strictly prohibited in either direction.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

Without a hard handoff boundary:

* audits drift toward recommendation engines
* content creation becomes self-justifying
* execution pressure corrupts observation

This Blueprint prevents audit contamination and content-led reinterpretation of truth.

---

## 3. Scope — What This Blueprint Governs

This Blueprint governs:

* the data and signals P3 may expose to P4
* the interpretation limits placed on P4
* sequencing and dependency rules
* prohibition of backward influence

---

## 4. Explicit Exclusions — What This Blueprint Does NOT Govern

This Blueprint does **not** govern:

* P4 content strategy or formatting
* publishing cadence or channel selection
* editorial voice or narrative framing
* relationship communications

---

## 5. Core Definitions

* **Audit Output:** Final, immutable observational signals produced by P3
* **Handoff:** The controlled exposure of audit outputs to downstream systems
* **Backward Influence:** Any attempt by P4 to alter P3 behavior, language, or cadence

---

## 6. Foundational Principles

* Observation precedes execution
* Audit outputs are descriptive, not prescriptive
* Content systems must accept audit truth without negotiation

---

## 7. Invariants & Non-Negotiables

The following rules must never be violated:

* P3 outputs are immutable
* P4 may not request re-runs, partial audits, or reinterpretation
* P3 may not emit tactics, instructions, or content recommendations
* P4 may not infer intent beyond what is explicitly stated
* No system may bypass P3 to initiate content

---

## 8. Pillar Ownership & Responsibilities

**P3 owns:**

* audit execution
* audit language
* scoring and confidence signals
* artifact generation

**P4 owns:**

* content ideation
* content creation
* publishing and distribution

No shared ownership exists.

---

## 9. Relationships to Other Pillars

* **P2:** Supplies entity data upstream of P3
* **P5:** Uses P4 outputs for relationship continuity

Neither P2 nor P5 may influence P3 execution.

---

## 10. Downstream Enforcement & Consumption Rules

P4 systems may consume only:

* finalized audit outputs
* explicit confidence and priority signals
* integrity flags

P4 systems must never:

* request additional audit context
* alter audit language
* store derived interpretations as audit data

---

## 11. Change, Replacement & Persistence Rules

* Changes require alignment with both P3 and P4 ownership
* Boundary violations require immediate remediation
* New downstream consumers must conform to this Blueprint

---

## 12. Compliance & Auditability

Compliance is validated by:

* absence of tactical language in P3 outputs
* absence of audit mutation requests from P4
* deterministic sequencing enforcement

Violations invalidate downstream execution.

---

## 13. Lock Statement

This Blueprint is authoritative and binding.

Any system, document, or execution behavior that violates this P3 → P4 boundary must be
