## 1. Purpose & Authority

This Blueprint defines the **authoritative handoff contract** between:

- **P3 — Audit (Observation)**
- **P4 — Execution (Language & Content Artifacts)**

Its purpose is to enforce a **strict, one-way boundary** that preserves audit integrity while enabling disciplined downstream execution.

If any P4 behavior conflicts with this Blueprint, **this Blueprint prevails**.

---

## 2. Core Principle (Non-Negotiable)

> **P3 identifies pressure.  
> P4 supplies language.  
> P3 never instructs.  
> P4 never reinterprets.**

This separation is foundational to DGA governance.

---

## 3. What P3 Produces (Immutable)

P3 produces a **fixed audit artifact** containing:

- GEO total score  
- GEO factor-level scores  
- AIO total score  
- AIO factor-level observations  
- **Top 3 GEO Opportunities only**  
- Delta Summary (if applicable)  
- Competitor Insight Sidebar (if applicable)  

Once generated, this artifact is **immutable** for the cycle.

P3 explicitly does **not** produce:
- execution guidance  
- remediation steps  
- copy or content  
- timing or urgency language  
- numeric success targets  

---

## 4. What P4 Is Permitted to Consume

P4 may consume **only the following elements** from P3:

1. **Top 3 GEO Opportunity categories**
2. Corresponding GEO factor names
3. High-level deficiency context (directional only)
4. Account type (e.g., MP, REA)

P4 may **not** consume:
- numeric scores or maxima  
- deltas or historical comparisons  
- competitor data  
- audit wording verbatim  
- AIO observations as execution drivers  

---

## 5. GEO → AIO Causality (Explicit Lock)

DGA enforces the following causality:

> **GEO improvements are the only direct execution lever.  
> AIO changes are downstream effects and confirmatory signals.**

P4 must never treat AIO as:
- a primary execution input  
- a separate optimization target  
- a competing priority set  

---

## 6. P4 Execution Intent (Clarified)

P4 exists to:
- reduce ambiguity  
- improve clarity  
- reinforce professional identity  
- strengthen corroboration across GEO-controlled surfaces  

P4 does **not** exist to:
- chase AI outputs  
- optimize for named platforms  
- respond to individual AI answers  
- publish content solely for volume  

---

## 7. Language Artifact Eligibility Rule

For each Top 3 GEO opportunity, P4 must assess:

> **Can this pressure be reduced through better language on a GEO surface?**

If **yes**:
- P4 supplies governed language or copy
- Language is clarity-first, non-promotional, AI-parsable
- Artifacts may be reused across approved GEO surfaces

If **no**:
- No artifact is produced
- The pressure persists until structural correction occurs

---

## 8. Approved P4 Artifact Classes (Illustrative)

Permitted P4 artifacts include:
- identity clarification copy  
- entity disambiguation language  
- profile description normalization  
- service taxonomy phrasing  
- corroboration blocks  
- answer-style summaries  
- derivative reinforcement snippets  

All artifacts must:
- map to GEO surfaces  
- avoid tactics and marketing claims  
- remain execution-neutral  

---

## 9. AIO-Informed, Not AIO-Driven

AIO observations may influence:
- tone simplicity  
- wording clarity  
- explanatory depth  

AIO observations must **never**:
- override GEO priority  
- introduce new execution priorities  
- justify standalone actions  

---

## 10. Temporal Discipline

- P4 artifacts are produced **within the audit cycle**
- P4 makes **no guarantees** of improvement
- Validation occurs only via the **next P3 audit**

No feedback loop exists inside a single cycle.

---

## 11. Ad-Hoc Audit Containment

Ad-hoc audits are:
- internal-authority only  
- diagnostic in nature  

Ad-hoc audits:
- are invisible to P4  
- do not trigger execution  
- do not reset baselines or deltas  

---

## 12. Audit Immutability Protection

- P4 may not modify or annotate audits  
- P4 may not request regeneration  
- P4 may not override Top 3 selection  

Audit truth is final for the cycle.

---

## 13. Governance & Change Control

Any change to this handoff requires:
- a versioned update to this Blueprint  
- confirmation of P3 and P4 impact  
- lock renewal  

---

## 14. Lock Statement

> This Blueprint is authoritative and binding.  
> The P3 → P4 handoff defined herein is **LOCKED** and may be modified only through formal governance revision.
