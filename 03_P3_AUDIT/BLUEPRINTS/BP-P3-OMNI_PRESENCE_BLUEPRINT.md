# BP–P3–OMNI-PRESENCE BLUEPRINT

Canonical Authority Model for Visibility, Corroboration & Audit-Governed Presence

Version: v11.0  
Created: 2025-12-14  
Status: Governing Authority (Active)

Primary Pillar: P3 — Audit  
Consumed By: P4 — Content Creation & Publishing  
Explicitly Excluded: P1, P2, P5

---

## FOUNDER DOCTRINE

This Blueprint documents **decisions already made**.

It exists to:
- prevent system drift
- constrain interpretation
- protect long-term trust
- ensure execution follows intent

If a downstream system, Execution Doctrine, SOP, or automation conflicts with this Blueprint, **the conflict must be resolved here first**.

---

## 1. PURPOSE & AUTHORITY

This Blueprint defines **what Omni-Presence means inside DGA** at the authority and audit level.

It governs:
- how presence is **defined**, not produced
- how authority signals are **interpreted**, not optimized
- how GEO and AIO observations are **evaluated**, not exploited

This document is **governing**, not advisory.

It does **not** describe:
- content creation workflows
- publishing mechanics
- cadence decisions
- relationship follow-up

Those belong to downstream pillars.

---

## 2. ROLE OF THIS BLUEPRINT IN DGA

Within the locked pillar model:

- **P3 (Audit)** defines *truth*
- **P4 (Content)** executes *artifacts*
- **P5 (Relationship Continuity)** preserves *human trust*

This Blueprint belongs to **P3** because it defines:

> what must exist for an entity to be considered present, corroborated, and recommendable.

Content creation is **downstream execution**, never upstream authority.

---

## 3. OMNI-PRESENCE — WHAT IT IS (AND IS NOT)

### Omni-Presence **IS**

- A governed model for **entity corroboration**
- A definition of **required authority artifacts**
- A framework for **audit-based visibility assessment**
- A constraint system that prevents arbitrary publishing

### Omni-Presence **IS NOT**

- A content strategy
- A social media plan
- A distribution checklist
- A growth hack or engagement tactic

Presence is **observed**, not manufactured.

---

## 4. DESIGN DOMAINS (CONCEPTUAL, NOT OPERATIONAL)

Omni-Presence operates across four conceptual domains:

1. **Entity Identity**
   - Name, role, geography, niche
   - Verified and normalized upstream (P2)

2. **Authority Artifacts**
   - Canonical long-form content
   - Persistent, indexable proof of expertise

3. **Platform Corroboration**
   - Presence across required platforms
   - Consistency of entity signals

4. **Temporal Continuity**
   - Ongoing existence over time
   - Absence is observable and material

These domains **define what audits look for**.  
They do not define how artifacts are created.

---

## 5. AUDIT AS THE SYSTEM SOURCE OF TRUTH

Within DGA:

- Audit results are **authoritative**
- Content plans are **derivative**
- Publishing is **reactive to audit insight**

The direction of flow is **strictly one-way**:

AUDIT → INSIGHT → CONTENT → DISTRIBUTION


Any system that reverses this flow violates this Blueprint.

---

## 6. GEO & AIO — SEPARATION OF RESPONSIBILITY

### GEO (Generative Entity Optimization)
- Observes **entity corroboration**
- Evaluates structural authority signals
- Measures consistency and persistence

### AIO (AI Answer Optimization)
- Observes **answer-level visibility**
- Evaluates recommendation likelihood
- Measures contextual relevance

Both are:
- **observational**
- **non-authoritative**
- **inputs**, not decision engines

No AI platform is a source of truth.

---

## 7. AUDIT TYPES & CADENCE (GOVERNANCE ONLY)

This Blueprint governs audit **meaning**, not scheduling.

Recognized audit classes:

- **Snapshot Audits**
  - Day 00 baseline
  - Periodic reassessment

- **Internal Monitoring**
  - Silent ecosystem observation

- **Adhoc Diagnostic Audits**
  - Prospecting checks
  - Competitive context
  - Anomaly investigation

Only **scheduled snapshot audits** may inform content planning.

---

## 8. SCORING PHILOSOPHY & TIME MECHANICS

Scores represent:
- **relative state**
- **directional movement**
- **contextual confidence**

Scores do **not** represent:
- performance guarantees
- growth velocity
- effort attribution

Time is treated as:
- linear
- non-accelerated
- resistant to manipulation

Momentum cannot be forced.

---

## 9. LANGUAGE & CONFIDENCE CONSTRAINTS

All systems governed by this Blueprint must:

- avoid certainty claims
- avoid outcome promises
- avoid comparative superiority language
- reflect probabilistic reality

Confidence emerges from **corroboration**, not claims.

---

## 10. UNCERTAINTY AS A DESIGN FEATURE

Uncertainty is:
- expected
- preserved
- surfaced

Systems must not:
- smooth uncertainty away
- infer missing context
- fabricate confidence

When signals are unclear, the correct response is **restraint**.

---

## 11. GOVERNED SYSTEM EVOLUTION

This Blueprint allows evolution **only** through:

- explicit versioning
- documented rationale
- downstream compatibility review

Silent drift is prohibited.

---

## 12. NON-NEGOTIABLE INVARIANTS

The following are absolute:

- Audit defines truth
- Content never defines authority
- Omni-Presence is governed, not tactical
- GEO and AIO are observational only
- Flow is one-way: Audit → Content
- Human trust is protected elsewhere (P5)

Violation of any invariant invalidates execution.

---

## 13. DOWNSTREAM ENFORCEMENT

This Blueprint is enforced by:

- **ED–P3–Audit Core**
- P4 Execution Doctrines (consumption only)
- Registry-aligned schemas
- System gating and audit lifecycle controls
