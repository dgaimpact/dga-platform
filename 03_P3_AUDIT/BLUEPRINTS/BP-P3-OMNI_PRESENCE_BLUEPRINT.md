# P3-OMNI_PRESENCE_BLUEPRINT

## Document Metadata
- **Blueprint:** P3 – Omni-Presence Evaluation Framework
- **Version:** v1.1
- **Status:** Canonical
- **Owner:** Digital Growth Accelerator (DGA)
- **Last Updated:** 2025-01-28
- **Supersedes:** v1.0
- **Scope:** Conceptual / Strategic (non-executional)

---

## 1. Purpose

This blueprint defines how **Omni-Presence** is conceptually evaluated within the DGA **P3 Audit framework**.

Omni-Presence represents the **legitimacy, consistency, and discoverability of a professional entity** across:
- the open web,
- dominant consumer discovery platforms, and
- AI-mediated search and recommendation environments.

This document defines **what matters and why**.  
It intentionally does **not** define crawling logic, query mechanics, tooling, or implementation details.

---

## 2. Omni-Presence vs Traditional SEO

P3 Omni-Presence evaluation is **not traditional SEO**.

It does not focus on:
- keyword rankings,
- backlink volume,
- tactical optimization tricks.

Instead, P3 evaluates whether an entity:
- exists clearly,
- is consistently represented,
- is corroborated across independent surfaces,
- can be confidently recommended by AI systems.

---

## 3. Entity-Centric Evaluation Model

### 3.1 Entity Bundle (Canonical Clarification)

Within P3, **brand identity is treated as an _Entity Bundle_**, not a single literal brand string.

An Entity Bundle may include:
- a **primary domain** (authoritative owned property),
- one or more **public-facing names**, including:
  - personal name,
  - DBA or branded name,
  - brokerage-affiliated name,
- **known aliases** derived from authoritative sources.

Aliases may be surfaced from:
- website titles, headings, and structured data,
- Google Business Profile naming,
- linked social or professional profiles.

Omni-Presence is evaluated **across the Entity Bundle**, allowing legitimate variation between:
- personal brand,
- domain brand,
- brokerage overlay.

This reflects real-world professional branding and avoids penalizing valid naming divergence.

---

## 4. Core Omni-Presence Surfaces

P3 evaluates omni-presence across the following surface categories:

### 4.1 Owned Properties
- Primary website
- Primary domain content
- Structured data and entity declarations

### 4.2 Platform Anchors
- Google Business Profile (GBP)
- Core professional social presences (e.g., LinkedIn, Facebook Business)

These anchors establish **baseline legitimacy**.

### 4.3 Earned & Third-Party Signals
- Review platforms
- Directory mentions
- Independent citations
- Press or reference mentions

These surfaces validate the entity beyond self-owned claims.

---

## 5. Review Presence Philosophy (Clarified)

Review presence within P3 is **platform-agnostic**.

Any legitimate third-party review surface surfaced organically in the open web may contribute to review visibility signals, provided:
- entity identification is consistent, and
- signals corroborate the same Entity Bundle.

Evaluation emphasizes:
- presence across multiple independent surfaces,
- corroboration with other omni-presence signals,
- consistency of entity naming and location.

No preferred, exclusive, or allow-listed review platforms are assumed beyond mandatory identity anchors (e.g., Google Business Profile).

This prevents vendor bias and reflects how AI systems assess trust signals in aggregate.

---

## 6. Consistency & Corroboration

Omni-Presence strength increases when:
- entity names align across surfaces,
- location references are consistent,
- services are described coherently,
- independent sources corroborate existence.

Perfect uniformity is **not required**.  
Reasonable variation is acceptable when:
- signals clearly reference the same entity,
- conflicts can be reconciled contextually.

---

## 7. Omni-Presence in AI-Mediated Environments (AIO)

AI systems do not “rank pages” — they assess **confidence**.

Confidence is derived from:
- entity clarity,
- repetition across trusted sources,
- absence of contradictions,
- breadth of corroboration.

P3 Omni-Presence evaluation is designed to model **AI confidence formation**, not algorithmic ranking.

---

## 8. Diagnostic Role of P3

P3 is **diagnostic**, not prescriptive.

It answers:
- “Is this entity clearly and consistently represented?”
- “Would an AI system confidently recommend this professional?”

It does **not**:
- prescribe marketing tactics,
- generate content strategy,
- enforce optimization techniques.

Those actions occur in downstream workflows (e.g., P4, P5).

---

## 9. Governance & Separation of Concerns (Clarified)

This blueprint defines:
- conceptual factors,
- evaluative philosophy,
- signal interpretation principles.

It intentionally excludes:
- crawling strategies,
- query planning,
- cost controls,
- execution tooling.

P3 discovery and auditing processes are designed to prioritize **high-impact omni-presence factors** while remaining **cost-aware at scale**.  
Execution mechanics are governed separately to prevent architectural drift.

---

## 10. Version History

- **v1.0** – Initial omni-presence blueprint
- **v1.1** – Clarified:
  - Entity Bundle model
  - Platform-agnostic review philosophy
  - Cost-aware governance principles

---

## 11. Canonical Status

This document is the **authoritative conceptual reference** for:
- P3 Omni-Presence evaluation
- GEO / AIO alignment discussions
- Future audit and scoring evolution

All implementation must remain aligned to this blueprint unless superseded by a formally versioned update.
