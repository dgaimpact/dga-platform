## 1. Purpose

This SOP defines **when human audit review is required, optional, or prohibited** within **P3 — Audit**.

Its purpose is to:
- protect audit integrity
- prevent over-review and false certainty
- ensure human judgment is applied only where it materially improves trust
- preserve audit as an observational system, not an optimization engine

Human review is **selective by design**.

---

## 2. What This SOP Governs

This SOP governs:

- Triggers for mandatory human audit review
- Conditions where review is optional
- Situations where review must not occur
- Boundaries between observation and interpretation

This SOP applies to **all audit classes**.

---

## 3. What This SOP Does *Not* Govern

This SOP does **not** govern:

- Audit scoring models
- Content planning decisions
- Publishing or distribution actions
- Client communications
- Relationship follow-up (P5)

This SOP governs **review thresholds**, not outcomes.

---

## 4. Mandatory Human Review Triggers

Human audit review **must occur** when **any** of the following conditions are present.

### 4.1 Structural Ambiguity

- Entity signals are inconsistent or contradictory
- Platform corroboration is unclear or fragmented
- Required authority artifacts are partially present but misaligned

---

### 4.2 Material Change Detection

- Significant deviation from prior audit state
- Sudden appearance or disappearance of authority signals
- Unexplained shifts in visibility or recommendability indicators

---

### 4.3 Intake Edge Cases

- Provisional or incomplete intake data
- Known constraints flagged during P2
- Entity normalization required interpretation

---

### 4.4 Risk Indicators

- Potential reputational, regulatory, or ethical concerns
- Signals that may affect Trust Network integrity
- Any condition that could invalidate downstream execution if misinterpreted

---

## 5. Optional Human Review Conditions

Human audit review **may occur** (at discretion) when:

- Signals are borderline but stable
- Contextual nuance may improve confidence
- Audit results will inform strategic discussion rather than execution
- Diagnostic audits are exploratory in nature

Optional review must not override audit neutrality.

---

## 6. Prohibited Review Scenarios

Human audit review **must not occur** when:

- Signals are clear and unambiguous
- Review would imply certainty or prediction
- Review would lead to prescriptive guidance
- Review would convert observation into optimization
- Review exists solely to “add confidence”

No review is preferable to false authority.

---

## 7. Review Conduct Principles

When review occurs, it must:

- Preserve uncertainty where it exists
- Avoid outcome framing or implication
- Distinguish clearly between observation and interpretation
- Be documented as review, not fact

Human judgment supplements — it does not replace — audit truth.

---

## 8. Documentation & Traceability

All mandatory reviews must be:

- Explicitly noted
- Attributed to review conditions
- Distinguishable from automated outputs

Absence of review documentation implies no review occurred.

---

## 9. Enforcement Rule

If audit review is required under this SOP and does not occur:

- Audit results are incomplete
- Downstream execution must pause
- Review must be completed before progression

Conversely, unauthorized review invalidates audit neutrality.

---

## 10. Lock Statement

This SOP is authoritative.

Any audit behavior that applies human review outside these rules violates P3 governance and must be corrected.
